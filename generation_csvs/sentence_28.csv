So, it's a lot of work to edit a video."	The same way you can take a bunch of photos and put them together to make a video. But what if you want to take a video and make a bunch of photos out of it? You can do that with a tool called a frame grabber
But it’s a very special kind of photos, where the photos are put together in a way that makes them look like they’re moving, and the audio and video synchronize together. So how do you take still photos and make a video out of them	generation_70	Each photo in a video is called a frame. When you watch a video, you are seeing a whole lot of frames put together, one after the other. To create a video, you need to tell the computer where the pixels in each frame are
"The more photos, the smoother the video, the higher the resolution, the more realistic the image.

What is a painting? A photo is a picture, a painting. A video is a series of pictures, a series of paintings, a series of frames.

Some software blurs out the joins between the photos, and then plays the images at a speed where the motion appears to be smooth. The rate at which it changes each frame from the previous one (the frame rate) is the number of pictures per	generation_72	To make a video, you need to use a video camera. The most popular video cameras are digital video cameras. They work like digital cameras, but they can take videos as well as pictures. Most digital video cameras are a bit more expensive than digital
"Each of the photos is called a frame, and the rate they go by is called the frame rate. The frame rate for video is usually 24 or 30 frames per second.

So we can represent a video as a list of images. This is how we’ll think about video on this blog. In case you want to know more about video theory, check out this article from 1994, or this one from	generation_74	"So, it’s easy to create a stop-motion video with just a few photos. You can use a camera, a phone, or another video device.

"So, if you have a video file on your computer, you can just use the same technique to find out what’s in it.

You’ll need to install the video player of your choice, then open the video file and press “ctrl+shift"	You don't need any special equipment. Just an iPhone or Android phone, or a digital camera, and a file to edit the video with. On an iPhone or Android, you can use Instagram, or the standard camera app. On a digital camera	generation_75
"There, we said it. So, don't be fooled by all the fancy terms about frames per second, the difference between h.264 and Quicktime, and so on. It's still just a bunch of photos!

We've already given you"	You have to make sure that each photo goes along well with the others. In other words, you have to make sure that the individual frames flow together so that the audience does not become aware of the individual photos. This is called matching the action.	generation_76
generation_77	So the way to create a video is to create a bunch of photos and then put them together. Luckily for us, it’s not this hard at all. We don’t need to take photos, we can create them. There are a number of	A bunch of high-resolution photos. If we do the math, that means 30 frames times 30 frames times 24 pixels per frame times 24 bits per pixel is 24 megabytes. If you can imagine, that's a lot of
These photos are displayed at a particular rate.  The number of times a frame is displayed per second is called the frame rate.  A low frame rate will make the video appear slow.  A high frame rate will make	generation_78	"It takes a lot of them. For a movie that's just two hours long, it'll be about 24 photos every second. That's a lot of photos!

If you're going to make a video, you'll need a movie camera."
generation_79	"Photos are still images. Video is a bunch of still images put together in a certain way so that the human eye will interpret them as motion. Motion can be faked, but the illusion is so strong that it’s hard to dismiss.

You put one photo on the screen, then another one, then another one. In order to make a video, you need to take a lot of photos and put them together. Each of these separate photos is called an image. And each image is	generation_80	This is the simplest way to explain. A video is a series of pictures put together to create an animation; it is a short film. Videos can be shown to advertise a product or service, or they can be shown to inform or entertain the audience
generation_81	"Therefore, if you want to control the video effect, you need to know how to control the photos! That’s why one of the best things to do when you’re just starting out in video is to take control of your photos.

I have a"	"So you can make a video by just taking a lot of different photographs and putting them together. You don’t actually have to take the video, you can just take a lot of photos and then stitch them together.

The problem with this is that you"
generation_82	But how do you make the photos move? The computer (more specifically, the video card, video drivers, and operating system) puts each photo on the screen for 1/30th of a second, then the next photo, and so on	"So if you want to change the video’s speed, you make the images run faster or slower. That’s how you get fast-forwarding, slow motion, and reverse.”

This might just be the biggest innovation in video since the birth of YouTube —"
generation_83	"So, if you can take a good picture, you can make a good video.

There are a lot of ways to create good photos, but for now we’ll just focus on one: Exposure. Exposure is what determines how bright or dark a photo"	So a 4K video is a bunch of 4K photos. If a 4K video is 30 frames per second, that’s 30 4K photos per second. That can take up a lot of space. But if
generation_84	So in order to put them together, you need to figure out the order in which they go. This is called sequencing. You can sequence photos manually, but if you have a lot of videos to make, it will take a lot of time.	"It has a beginning, middle, and end. The beginning of the video is the first frame. The last frame is the end of the video.

The frame rate is the number of frames per second. 30 frames per second is a good starting"
generation_85	When you take a video with your phone, it takes a series of photos -- a frame -- and then puts all those frames together to make a video. If you’re recording with a phone, it takes a photo every 0.5 seconds.	"There are many programs that you can use to make a video, such as Windows Movie Maker, PowerDirector, and iMovie. These programs are very easy to use and are free.

When you're done with your video, you can upload it to"
As our camera and phone technology has improved, there are now millions of photos taken every second, most of which are never seen by anyone other than the photographer. But what if we could use some of these images to help us see the world better?	generation_86	The same logic applies to them.  The camera can't tell the difference between a moving object and the background. So, if you take a photo and move a little in the next shot, the camera will think that the background has moved. This

It’s not the same as a movie, where each frame is different from the next. A video is a movie which is played back at a certain speed, usually 24 frames per second. This is known as the frame rate or frame frequency.	generation_97	"So it is not that hard to get an idea of what needs to happen. However, there is a lot to talk about when it comes to the video format. Let’s start with the basics.

Video resolutions are measured in pixels vertically and horizontally."
generation_98	"Let's take a look at how we can make our own video.

Step 1: Set Up Your Project
