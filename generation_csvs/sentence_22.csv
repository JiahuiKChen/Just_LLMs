They are trained on a large amount of text, and can then generate text. They are often trained on the entire Wikipedia, for example. The training data is very important: the model will only be able to generate text that it is trained on.	We can use the outputs of the language models to create a “fake text”. But these are not the only way to create “fake news”. I have a friend who tells me that he can create a fake news using a simple script (Python)	generation_70
They are very large networks that are trained on a large corpus of text. They are used for tasks such as translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering. They are trained by feeding them raw text and then having them predict the next word in a sentence	generation_71	A neural network is a set of nodes that connect to each other via edges. Nodes are connected by weights. Each node is activated by its inputs (the sum of its inputs multiplied by their weights), and then passes the activation along to its connected nodes
Neural networks are just very complicated matrices. And so they are very easy to scale. But the more data you put in, the more parameters you have to learn. So if you have a thousand parameters, it’s easy to learn, but if you	Like neural networks, they consist of interconnected neurons. Each neuron takes as input a set of (real-valued) numbers, called its activation. A neural network tries to find a pattern in the numbers it’s given. It does this by adjusting the	generation_72

This is the technique of feeding a computer with large amounts of language data and letting the computer find patterns in it. With enough training data, the computer is able to learn to predict the next word in a sentence based on what came before. This means	When you do a google search, you’re really just feeding a huge neural network the search terms and letting it process the results.   It’s the same way a self-driving car’s neural network is taking in the sensor data	generation_76

When we talk about pretraining like we did with BERT, we are just talking about initialising the weights of the neural network with a large random vector. The fact that this initialisation is done by running the model on a lot of text is	That is, they are a collection of interconnected nodes that are interconnected with each other.

The size of the data and the number of parameters in the model determine the quality of the model. However,	They are trained on large amounts of text data, usually millions of words. They learn the statistical distribution of words in the data. Then they are fed new words and they’re able to predict the probability of what the next word will be. This is
For example, the GPT-3 language model is an 117-layer transformer. A transformer is a type of neural network, and the number of layers is how many times it is processed. So, in this case, you can think of it	generation_82	They process text data and predict the next word in a sentence. They are composed of a stack of layers of neurons. Each layer has a different function. Some layers are responsible for recognizing patterns, some for classifying them. Other layers are responsible for
They are used for natural language processing. NLP is a field of AI that deals with the interactions between computers and humans via natural languages.

Language Models

For a language model, it’s like predicting the next word in a sentence.

Language Models

generation_87	They are trained to predict the next word in a text. The more data, the better the predictions. For example, if you type “I just saw a red”, the network will predict “car” if you have trained it on lots of car	At the root of all of this is that the models we’ve been using in the past to do language processing, the RNNs, are limited in a variety of ways. The most obvious is that they’re sequential. They can’t see the
A neural net is a set of nodes (a.k.a. neurons) and connections between the nodes. A node is a function that takes a list of values (its inputs) and produces a value (its output).
