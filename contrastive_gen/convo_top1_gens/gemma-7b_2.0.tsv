Then Sally asks "	"<b>""Superb in what?""</b>


Is this a natural way of asking something?

Dave
You usually give an opinion of something in the same word class, so you say the movie is wonderful or the movie is great, but you shouldn't say:

* The movie is superb in English I want it"	"<b>""Apart from you""</b> What does the word ""Apart from"" mean?
Hi Karna;

Did Sally ask all the question?
Oh, I think they are aware that he's sick of that stupid movie and they don't want to hear a single more thing about it. So,"
"Dave says ""Smith just abhors Clancey's guts.""
Then Sally asks "	"<strong>""Wouldnt you say that's how most women feel about men who play golf for a living?""</strong>


And Dave, and William Smith's second wife Deny called her <strong>""old so and so""</strong>
Dave <strong>""And an a онаe.""
</strong>

<strong>Denys:"	"<i>descendants</i> Dave and Sally how it feels to be a pariah.

Ah, yes, to be the descendants of a pariah.
What cold comfort.

Like me owning a miller-distraught high school ""loser"" coat.
""All hail the Oyster King!""

Clay: Meet"	"Dave says ""Smith abhors Clancey's guts.""
Then Sally asks "	"<strong>Where's Sally from?</strong> She says,

"Dave says ""This wall paper is just horrendous.""
Then Sally asks "	"<i>""What is a horrendous?""</i>
So Dave takes her into the house and 21  seconds later there is a loud crash, which comes from Sally bursting a milk carton.

Dave replies ""The wall paper, of course.""
Sally says proudly ""Yes, and it done great what it do.""

Tina responds with ""Yes.""
Chuck grabs Tina by the neck"	"Dave says ""This wall paper is horrendous.""
Then Sally asks "	"<em>"" No moiterminez-moi ?""</em>.

<strong>"" I killed her?""</strong>

Verbum est Dei is Latin for <em>"" The Word is God.""</em>

I guessed he was a flesh eater (zombie?) and I was so convinced that my mind blanked on the word.

As the"	"3 questions...In effect asking the same question with each one over and over and over and over. Get the joke?
Sally replied, ""Everyone else's opinions are just guesses. Mine is a fact.""
""Oh, of COURSE it's a fact. Mine is too""
""No, mine"
"Dave says ""My mother-in-law's quiche is just to die for.""
Then Sally asks "	"<i>him</i> ""Did you hear what Harold said about my mother?""
Dave replies ""About your mother?"" He genuinely seems confused.
I am sure that anyone who watches those intimate, awkward moments between Dave and Sally could truly stretch the definitions of psychobabble and psychobabble bistros to the extreme.

"	"<i>""Why is there a fly in the quiche?""</i>
The kids would say <i>""Cause that's where flies be"",</i>
Occured to me we could get another word in;
<i><b>""It's cause that's <i>utterly dott</i>ar.""</b></i>

Then Sally asks "	"2 people to take her to MIW so that they'll have different experiences and report the problems they may or may not observe
Then one walks Sally to the dressing room to watch her try on clothes, the other waves his hands and Nicole turns around and walks over as if she's out of the room
"	"<i>""What is it about your mother-in-law's quiche?""</i>
Dave gives this vague answer <i>""I love all things bacon but you already know that.""</i>
Sally says I like everything with bacon but I would like some quiche.
Dave thinks he caught so basic compliments and says """
"Dave says ""That movie was just fantastic!""
Then Sally asks "	"<strong>""What did you <em>think</em> of that movie?""</strong>

<strong>Dave:</strong> ""It was just fantastic!""

<b>Sally</b>: ""I heard the same movie really freaked you out, not just because it was a horror movie, but because of other things. What did you think of it?""

"	"<b>""How magnificent was it?""</b>
Sally probably meant ""How fantastic was it?"". How do you call this mistake on the part of Sally?
What grammer is erroneous here? Could she not have said ""How magnificent THE movie was/were?""
Would you yourself call the statement false or misleading"	"Dave says ""That movie was fantastic!""
Then Sally asks "	"<u><b>itself</b></u> how she'd like to see it.

Sally's saying to <u><b>herself</b></u> she'd like to see it--not ""itself.""

Substitute the It with I or You. They are the same thing.

""That movie was fantastic!""
Then Sally"	"
""What movie had you talking so loudly you were yelling in your head?"" 
""Nobody"" Dave says (as he looks around). ""well this time it was FUN""
""It is kind of childish"" Sally says. 
""What are you talking about?"" 
""Dave, stop talking"
"Dave says ""The stars are just extrordinary tonight.""
Then Sally asks "	"<b>""The cats don't bother you do they?""</b>
Norwich Cathedral was built from 1096 to 1145. The village of Thorpe St.Adelph worked a quarry to the right of the Cathedral that supplied much of the Caen Stone used.

Then Sally asks "	"
""Where are the planets?""
""The planets are in the horison"", said Dave.

('|Dave says ""The stars are extrordinary tonight.""|       )
(   ""|The planets are'|                   )|  
(      ""|in the horison""|              )     )

That is a perfectly"	"<strong>""what for""</strong>.
But surely it should be ""What for ?"" (where is it going), not ""What for"", right?

Sorry, but no naysayers.

Nevertheless a great great movie !
