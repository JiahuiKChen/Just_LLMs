What is this dialogue mainly about? Dave and Sally are talking about different aspects of luxury cars. In the first part, Dave is sharing his opinion that luxury cars mainly have fancy finishes. In the second part, Sally is curious about different types of luxury cars"	"Dave says ""Luxury cars have fancier finishes.""
Then Sally asks "	" Dave the following:

What else should Sally ask to understand Dave's point fully? To understand Dave's point fully, Sally should ask: ""Are the finishes more unique or elaborate in luxury cars compared to non-luxury cars?"""
"Dave says ""A torus is just a donut.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Dave, are you saying donuts are just tori?""
Do you agree with either (or perhaps both) of them?
Or is one (or perhaps both) of them wrong?

Explain with evidence why or why not.

Then Dave says ""It means 7.5""""""
Do all donuts have the same ratio of hole circumference to outer circumference?

Yes, all donuts have the same ratio of hole circumference to outer circumference, if you consider the dimensions of a torus ( donut)"	"Dave says ""A torus is a donut.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""What are the surface area and volume of a torus with a major radius of 5 and a minor radius of 4?""
And Dave replies at length  "" The formulas for a torus have been lost to history, because of their complexity, but treat the major radius R and minor radius r as two unknown"	" ""Are the x, y, z coordinates required to plot a torus at a standard size? ""
Dave says ""No, they are not.""

Sally says ""Ok. What are they? If they are not x-, y-, z-coordinates along the torus?""
Is this question backwards? Or not?

"Dave says ""A quiche is just a breakfast casserole.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Can it be lunch?""
Next Timmy says ""Can it be dinner?"" 
Is Dave right?

Let’s break down the dialogue step-by-step to determine if Dave’s initial statement about a quiche simply being a breakfast casserole is accurate.

1. Dave's statement: A quiche is just a breakfast"	" ""It sounds delicious, if it contains sausage or bacon what could I call it?""
Does the word ""quiche"" mean the same thing in the above two sentences? Yes, the word ""quiche"" means the same thing in both sentences. A quiche is a type of baked dish with a thick pastry crust"	"Dave says ""A quiche is a breakfast casserole.""
Then Sally asks "	" Dave ""What casserole recipe would you suggest""?

Dave would probably say that a quiche recipe would be a good one.Create an iOS application of a Photo Album App with core data and gather the user to add photos to it. The application must be able to perform the following operations.

Then Sally asks "	" ""What's the difference between a sofa and a chair?""

What what they might be talking about?
They might be discussing the differences between a sofa and a chair, such as their size, shape, function, and how they are typically used in a household or living space.

Dave would likely be focusing on the idea that"	" ""Where do you sleep?""
How would Dave answer?

Options are: [i] In a bathroom. [ii] on a sofa. [iii] on an elevator. [iv] on a dive.

Then Sally asks "	" what long means.

Then Sally asks "	" ""And a park is just an apartment building for ...  sheep?"" and

So, whatever movie it is has to have both Dave saying the fence comment and

"Dave says ""The lights just turn on and off, even when no one is around.""
Then Sally asks "	" who fixes when they get stuck. Not the customer care  for sure.  The ""tension""  part of Dave's statement reminds Sally of tension on a string of lights - or any other container that is tightly fit to a surface.

Sally says ""Oh, that must be the smart sensor I wanted.""? ?
,

Is there more that Dave can say to explain how the motion sensor works?

Dave could say ""A motion sensor is a device that detects motion and can trigger"	"5 people if there is a storm. They all say that the lights have been refusing to turn off ever since the last storm.
Then Dave starts messing around with the switches before admitting in low voice that there are two holes in the ceiling of the house.

"Dave says ""Last week, a piano just fell from the sky onto Fifth Avenue.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Oh, how high up was the piano?""
Dave answers ""It hit the ground and then the keys of the piano went into the cement for four inches, went into the sidewalk, so you see how high down up the piano is if the sidewalk is now on top of it!""
What do we learn about Dave?
"	" ""Where?""
To which Dave replies ""Where?  Where do you think?  Brotherhood of Man did say Fifth Avenue, did they not?!"" 

So, does Dave make the claim ""It fell from the sky"", or ""The piano is on Fifth Avenue""? Both!

In this dialogue, Dave initially states"	"Dave says ""Last week, a piano fell from the sky onto Fifth Avenue.""
Then Sally asks "	" Dave says: ""Last week, a piano fell from the sky onto Fifth Avenue.""
Then Sally asks: ""Does ""it"" refer to the piano
or the sky?"".What is the ""it' "" that Sally is referring to? Is it a part of

"Dave says ""On Friday, the cars will just crash.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""But I am Odd One Out. Why won't they just crash?""
Dave says: ""But they just will!""

This is... odd. Why is Dave responding in this way? He says cars will just crash on Friday, but he doesn't explain why sure you know, but he says ""But they just will"	" if a mini silver bugatti also collides with Dave's Dodge then  does he even consider that a Dodge is going to have to go in to be made safe to be driven again. This is a very serious question. 
In order to provide a detailed and accurate answer, it would be helpful to know specific information"	"Dave says ""On Friday, the cars will crash.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Did the cars crash on Friday?""
Dave says ""No they didn't.""
But really the cars crashed the day before.
Which assumptions can applied to explain this?
I will use a simple approach with logical rules, involving David and Sally time.
Assuming that after the question is asked, the conversation is known to both"	"2 times
Sally says ""Look at the toy cars. I will not take them. I returned them to the store yesterday.""
Does this mean that Dave lied?
At 7:02, Dave said they wouldn't crash, and Sally said they wouldn't.
18 minutes later, at 7:"
"Dave says ""When we came in, the toys were just scattered everywhere.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""What if I want to play with all the toys?"" 
To explain this situation to a five-year-old, we could say that Dave comes inside and sees a lot of toys on the floor where they should be put away neatly. Then Sally asks if she can play with all the toys instead. In simpler words,"	"2 years later ""Where are my toys?""
Dave answers ""I give it back to them,"" implies ""found that toy earlier.""
Dave could have answered ""Keep quiet would you?""
Dave should have answered ""Someone in the house took them!"" and/or ""You failed to tidy your play area.""
Sally doesn't know"	"Dave says ""When we came in, the toys were scattered everywhere.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Dave, I lost my doll. Have you seen it?""

Dave says ""No, it has run away!""
At this point Bill comes in with Sally's doll hiding behind his back.

The question is: what did Dave mean when he said ""it has run away"". Dave said, ""it has run away"""	" ""What color were they?"" SIP begins ... ippa pipee stampi, ippa pipee stampi. Ball. ippa pipee stampi. Cat. ippa pipee stampi. Cup.
Dave says ""Oh, they were so many different colors - green, red, purple"
"Dave says ""He just doesn't listen to me.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Doesn't what?""
Dave says ""My advice.""
Step 1: Pay attention to the context and cues in the conversation. Dave blames his lack of impact on the change on Sally's unwillingness to listen to his advice.

Step 2: Analyze the phrases used by Dave and Sally. Dave emphasizes on"	" ""And what do you say?""
""I normally say hello and use the appropriate body language.""
This type of nonverbal cueing is NOT possible on the internet, but we do try
to compensate with ""smiley"" graphics. Here are some other techniques to
discuss here. Thanks for the topic!

Dave first hides his finger.

Sally says ""That doesn't mean anything to me, kid.
Dave says ""I live"	" ""How's your little problem kid going,""
and Dave replies ""What little problem kid?""

What is the relation between ""then"" and ""Sally asks"""	"Dave says ""I looked over and the dog was throwing up.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Well what does that mean?""
Answer ""It means the dog was expelling its contents by making repeated violent muscular contractions""
This means Dave looked over to check what was happening with the dog, and he saw that the dog was expelling its contents by making repeated violent muscular contractions, like what happens when something"	" ""What did you say Dave?""
And Tim decides to join in ""Did he say that Dave?""

"Dave says ""Two days ago she just stopped coming to work.""
Then Sally asks "	" "" What do you mean by that ?""
What was Dave talking about ?

Dave was talking about Sally not showing up for work for two consecutive days. He used the phrase ""Two days ago she just stopped coming to work"" to convey that she has been absent for an extended period and specifically that it started two days prior"	" ""Is she still working for us?""
In that case: Dave and Sally talk about two days in the past or the moment Dave talks to Sally?
In this scenario, Dave and Sally are talking about two days in the past. 

Dave says, ""Two days ago she just stopped coming to work."" This implies that"	"Dave says ""Two days ago she stopped coming to work.""
Then Sally asks "	" Alice, ""When was the first time Jane came to the office after Dave was fired?""

"Dave says ""Lana thinks he just won't show.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Will Lana just not show?""
No, no there is a difference. He really can just not show up anywhere. And I guess. He just didn't leave.
When they say just it is often used to emphasize something's lack of importance. So Sally's frame implies that he is not especially important or relevant."	" ""But don't Tommy and Tracy believe Dave knows as much as Kai tells him?""
Ultimately, Tracy answers ""Probably only Kai knows for sure, because Dave has promised not to tell.""
Based on these sentences, who is Dave?
Dave could be a character from a story, a friend, or even a person you know"	"Dave says ""Lana thinks he won't show.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Are you afraid of Dave?""

Sally knows that Lana thinks Dave will show and is afraid of him, so she asks him if he's afraid of Dave to find out if what Lana thinks about Dave is true.

Am I correct?

You're on the right track! Let's break this down for understanding:

1"	" Lana  ""Do you think Dave won't
show?""

""Nhh?""

Then Sally says to herself ""so Lana did think
that Dave won't show"".

Granted, is saying Nhh? the same as thinking so yeah? It doesn't sound like Lana is directly answering Sally's question by saying ""Nhh?"""
"Dave says ""I've just got a bad feeling about this.""

What are they?

Here are some possible questions that Sally might ask:

1. What exactly is wrong with it so don't just wimp out?
2. Are you sure this feeling is worth acting on or should I take it as a sign that I should get another job?

Explanation: The questions relate"
"Dave says ""She just left, out of the blue, two days ago.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""And where did she go?""
Is Dave  is truthful, when he says that she just left, out of the blue, two days ago as compared to ""And where did she go?""

Yes, Dave is telling the truth about her leaving two days ago. But, remember he didn't tell us where she went"	" ""Did she tell you where she’s going?""
If you tell me that Dave said something and then I say something else and I ask you a question about that something then what does it mean?
If Dave says what was said and then you say what was said then what does that mean? If you tell me that Dave"	"Dave says ""She left, out of the blue, two days ago.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Where's blue? Where's out? ""
There isn't one in the sentence! 
Out and blue
stop their work to find out! 
Out looks lost -- he doesn't know where's blue! 
""So let's sit down and talk 
""Let's try to work half this talk out! 
"	" ""How old is the two days?""

Is this an example of spoonerism?
Yes, this is an example of spoonerism. In this case, the word ""two"" was mistakenly substituted with ""two,"" giving the phrase: ""She left, out of the blue, blue, days ago.""

Alex: ""So, I fell at about 4PM.""
But Dave says: ""We've learned that"	" ""Wait, if Alex tripped, who caught him?""

A) Ben
B) Carole

1. The information provided is that Dave says, ""Yesterday, we were walking along, and Alex tripped on the sidewalk.""
2. From this"

When Sarah, Luke, and Katie get to the hospital, Luke devastates Sarah by saying, ""K"	" him  when exactly it is likely to occur again.  Maybe Dave will feel an amusement, as he is normally quite anti-lucky numbers and statistics.
Either way, everything anyway.  How could you win if you didn't believe in fate? 
No looking, no looking for the prize No looking at the boy"	"Dave says ""These things happen.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Can you repeat that?""
Dave correctly repeats what he said earlier.
Sally says ""Repeat me"" and says a different sentence.
Dave says those words back.

Dave refuses when Susan asks if he is attracted to her.

Sally will say: Just ignore the asking anyone. They pick wrong answers."
"Dave says ""Last week they just invited me over.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""too bad you never call.""

What is Dave trying to hide here? First, I will analyze each statement separately to understand the situation. Dave comments that he just received an unannounced visit, and then Sally responds by considering it ""too bad"" that Dave never calls her.

Dave seems to be hiding the fact"	" ""Why didn't you  tell me Dave?""
We can infer that Sally has an distrust in Dave's frankness
To infer that Sally has a distrust in Dave's frankness, we can analyze the conversation step-by-step:

1. Dave says, ""Last week they just invited me over."" This statement could suggest"	"Dave says ""Last week they invited me over.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Who invited you over?""
Dave      : ""Ronald invited me over.""
Then Sally asks  ""Ronald? Why did he invite you over?""
Dave      : ""Because he wanted this deal.""
Sally     : ""Known as a good friend, a risk-taking, shady deal like this was what he did"	" ""Last week over who, dag?""
Dave says ""Over the kids and my parents.""
Sally says ""Ah, so everybody was there!""
Dave says ""Everybody but Randy.""
Sally says ""But why not Randy?""
Dave says ""Randy got a new tattoo or something.""
Sally says ""Ooh,"
"Dave says ""The soup is just delicious.""
Then Sally asks "	" "" Why? ""
Dave says "" Just taste.""
Then Raghav tastes and he says "" Go, Go, Go!, It is just excellent.""
Sally smacks her Lips and crown her head. 
Sally drinks the soup and drops dead.

Summary:

Dave, Xiao Jun, and Raghav are in"	" ""Did you make this soup?""
Dave says ""It's the same as mine.""
Sally adds ""Let's try it.""


Who is cooking?
Dave is cooking this soup, based on the conversation described.

Is the vegemite real or fake? why did they bring vegetables in the zoo?
Vegemite"	"Dave says ""The soup is delicious.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Are you sure?""
Dave smiles mysteriously at Sally.
Then he says ""Soups are delicious.""
Yes or No?

Dave says ""Soups are delicious.""

Does ""Amari figures prominently in the numerology and cosmology of The Kebra Nagast, an early 14th-century Ethiopian book."" correctly"	" ""What does it taste like?""
Then Martha says ""It looks delicious."" There are two possible scenarios.

"Dave says ""The engine in this car is just awful.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""What engine was it?"" to which Dave answers ""Well, I'm not totally sure."".
Sally persists in asking Dave ""Can you even remember the make and model of this car?"" By this point she can understand that Dave's recollection of the car details is...
not perfectHuman: This task is"	" Steve: How is the engine?

Pick from: *It runs on solar power. *It is in need of an overhaul. *It runs on electric power.
He says: It is old so I guess it is in need of an overhaul."	"Dave says ""The engine in this car is awful.""
Then Sally asks "	" "" Do you mean the engine is fine?""

Is this grammatical?

David says ""The engine in this car isn't fantastic.""
Then Sally asks ""Do you mean it isn't terrible?""

Is this grammatical?
First question is correct; second is not. Someone would not say ""...isn't fantastic"" for"	" ""What's wrong with it?""
Which of the following verbs would be used to most naturally answer Sally's question 
  
 A-rot
  
 B-stew
  
 C-rob
  
 D-sweat

C-rob

Dave is stating that the engine in his car is “awful,” which evidently means it is faulty"
"Dave says ""This kind of behavior is just not ok.""
Then Sally asks "	" Dave to be more specific.

What is a natural response of Dave? Dave looks at me sharply and says ""That is so obvious Sally""Objective perspective of ""The Jungle Book"" by Rudyard Kipling The Jungle Book is like a magical storybook about a man named Mowgli who lives in a forest"	" ""What are you talking about""?
She then points out ""
""That is just the way.lastIndexOf works"".

You wonder, what is really the problem with this behavior? Have a look at this example"	"Dave says ""This kind of behavior is not ok.""
Then Sally asks "	" ""Is this a joke?""

^Is This A Joke? Dave is not saying anything more when Sally is asking, but for me (as a non-native speaker of English), ""This kind of behavior not ok,"" is just a kind of statement. It's not like David should also ask, ""Yes, this"	" ""What kind of behavior is that?""
Dave answers ""This kind of behavior which is not ok.""
How did this conversation get repeated endlessly like this? Both Dave and Sally believe that others feel the same things that they themselves do. So Sail talked to Jen and told Jen that this behavior is not ok. Jen didn't"
