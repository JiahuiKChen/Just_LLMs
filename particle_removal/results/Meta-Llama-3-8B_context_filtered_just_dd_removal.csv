It won’t take much time to design an amazing card, but it can make a big difference among the crowd. And you’ll always notice it from your collection.

We had a lot of fun learning together. It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues.__eou__Well, that is also very efficient, right?

My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law, where I have been able to apply my paralegal education. I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts. I really love research and analyzing facts.

I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used.__eou__What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession?	Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job. In my last position, I supported four lawyers, and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week. There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything. I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball. At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, explained my situation, and got their input.	Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job.
