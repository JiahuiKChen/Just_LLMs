2469	not	Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’s get started!__eou__Let’s start with the basics, bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.__eou__Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk about the ingredients! Of course, each person’s palate is different, but I’m going to give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.	Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident — cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs — you can’t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!	-188.94961178302765	-188.70799326896667	8.714174349564293e-83	1.1095830970666459e-82	-0.24161851406097412	0.7853557225773858	True
