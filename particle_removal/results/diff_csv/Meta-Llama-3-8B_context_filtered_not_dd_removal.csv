1010	not	In 1986, a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment. This sport is very challenging. It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance. Especially when descending, as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back, they sway around. The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it. Even if they jump off, they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes. No wonder people give the title' brave' to anyone who jumps off.	You see, the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then, like diving, their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth. The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend. They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord.

2469	not	Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’s get started!__eou__Let’s start with the basics, bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.__eou__Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk about the ingredients! Of course, each person’s palate is different, but I’m going to give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.	Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident — cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs — you can’t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!	0.03255925958594119
