2469	just	Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’s get started!__eou__Let’s start with the basics, bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.__eou__Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk about the ingredients! Of course, each person’s palate is different, but I’m going to give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.__eou__Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident — cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs — you can’t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.	Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!

I want to be able to get online, play games and chat with my friends. Oh, and watch movies online as well.	Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs. I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes. That way you can play games online without any lag. This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free!	-146.10989379882812	-145.50456619262695	3.5097757719111625e-64	6.429390598253685e-64	-0.6053276062011719	0.5458955585719847	True

We must lift the person’s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs. Then we place our mouth over the other person’s mouth and blow air two or three times, like this.

8522	just	Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?__eou__What? Why do we have to do that?__eou__Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.__eou__I see. That’s convenient! I never understood things like this, such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!	That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time.

8550	just	Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review. My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson.__eou__Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?__eou__Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man’s eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it’s a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.__eou__I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.__eou__Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It’s a G-rated movie! It’s for the kids! It’s not a thriller!	Well, that’s just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it’s his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It’s just too cliche.	Well, that’s it.

My major in college was English, and as a result, my writing skills are my major strength. I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used.__eou__What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession?	Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job. In my last position, I supported four lawyers, and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week. There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything. I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball. At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, explained my situation, and got their input.	Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job.

You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries.

A 10 % commission will not leave us much.__eou__According to your estimate, what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill, in round figures, of course?__eou__We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business, as our remuneration increases with the turnover, but we will not guar - ante anything, at least not to begin with.__eou__We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products. But our suggestion to you, Mr. Bergeron, as a preliminary step, is to do a little research into the market ...__eou__Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency?__eou__Mr. Bergeron, you leave us no alternative. We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover.

In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don’t really trust it so they invest in properties or things like that.	That seems a bit unstable don’t you think?	-34.09297180175781	-34.50489044189453	1.5617462608022341e-15	1.0344666222022047e-15	0.41191864013671875	1.509711601402412	True
13087	just	Hello, Sir, may I help you?__eou__Yes. I would like some information for requesting a loan.__eou__Very well, here are the general terms of our loan policies. We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.__eou__I see. So let me get this straight. If I borrow let’s say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?__eou__It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate. This of course is considering that you don’t default on a payment!	It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.	It sounds good but, there is one problem. I have a terrible credit score.	That is a very serious problem you see, the bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan.	-106.88402557373047	-106.93144989013672	3.809408001909691e-47	3.6329663125982587e-47	0.04742431640625	1.0485668388114624	True

13095	just	I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That' s what you think, yes?__eou__Yes. You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient. I recommend seven.__eou__And if we take the Decker units you suggested, what would the price be?__eou__Let me calculate the price for you. I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let' s see here. Your total would be 5929 dollars.__eou__Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building?__eou__As I said, it is possible, but it would be much more expensive. I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system.__eou__That's too much. We need to use the separate units, I guess.__eou__It's more practical, and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them.__eou__So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars.__eou__Yes, that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent, of course.__eou__You mean installation isn't included?
