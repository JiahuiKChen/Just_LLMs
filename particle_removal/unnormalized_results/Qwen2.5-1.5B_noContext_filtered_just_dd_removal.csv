I don’t know if you’re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. There’s too much instability. I wouldn’t feel comfortable investing in this climate.	But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway, I’m not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for example.they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.	-219.5279245376587	-218.72371864318848	4.573342736756897e-96	1.0221059863478353e-95	-0.8042058944702148	0.44744310255908554	False
