The Dyson, however, is not worth the extra money, and is the very definition of a ""gimmick."" Don't believe"	And the force of the vacuum is pulling the water up along the side of the glass, and pushing it into the cup. The water is being sucked up. That's called suction. Vacuum can do a lot of things. It can even lift water
generation_73	We all know how those work. But what if you apply the same principle to something like a telescope? Or a microscope? Then you get a device that can not only focus light, but also do things like magnify or block it from reaching your	"Yes, the same vacuum you use to clean your floor, only this one is designed to clean the air of particulate matter.

The earth	The vacuum turns on when the sensor detects the presence of methane. The vacuum sucks up the methane, which gets burned off by the burner. The system is designed so that the burner stays off unless the vacuum is on. This prevents methane from leaking out

generation_79	"It sucks the air in through the bottom, and the fan blows the air out through the top. The fan is powered by a small solar panel.

This thing is very loud, and the fans are not balanced, so it will wobble around on"	It is a vacuum that is designed to have a very large pressure differential between the inside and the outside. So the inside is at 1/10 of 1 atmosphere, the outside is at 1 atmosphere pretty much. So you're doing pretty
generation_80	It's not actually sucking the air out of the bag, it's just creating a low pressure area that is smaller than the pressure on the outside of the bag, so it sucks the air out. If you have your own vacuum cleaner that is not	It’s not all that different from the vacuum cleaner you have at home. When you suck something up with a vacuum cleaner, the air pressure outside the vacuum cleaner is greater than the air pressure inside it. The same is true of your lungs when you
generation_81	The pump is powered by an electric motor. The suction is caused by the pump. It works by pulling the water up through the hose, and then pushing it down the drain. It's basically a siphon, but your vacuum is the pump	It’s a vacuum that’s been specially designed to suck air in from around the car and then remove that air from the car. The net result of doing that is to equalize the pressure inside the car with the pressure outside the car. That’s

Here's how it works. The pump sucks air out of the bag, creating a vacuum inside the bag. This causes the bag"	"And it's just one of the many tools that enable your very own vacuum cleaner to suck up all the dust, dirt and debris that it can get its hands on.

Now, you may be thinking, ""vacuum? How can it be a"
generation_83	The reason it works is because the vacuum creates a negative pressure. Negative pressure means that the pressure within the container is less than the pressure outside the container, and that difference sucks things into the container. The more negative the pressure, the greater the sucking	"The vacuum is attached to an electrical element that heats the water and makes it rise into a chamber. The water is then forced out through a nozzle and used for cleaning.

He invented a vacuum cleaner that	Put a vacuum in the room, and it's going to suck up the air, and the air pressure inside is going to be lower than outside. And if you have a window in the room, you're going to open it, because the pressure

Those holes let air in and out of the bag.	And the fact that I'm able to use it is a testament to the fact that I have a good, working, mostly reliable (albeit somewhat temperamental) body. So when I saw that picture, I was reminded of the fact that there

What is a vacuum?

generation_91	That's why the vacuum is the most common piece of equipment you see in the gym. And it's not just the exercise machines that use vacuums -- the exercise balls you see in a lot of classes and gyms use vacuum as well.	"It’s also a piece of history.

""In the late 1960s a vacuum cleaner used more than 1,000 watts,"" said Stolk."	A vacuum is a space that has no air. It's like an empty space. A vacuum is an area with no air. And that's what this machine does. It's going to use the pressure difference between the inside of the bell jar and
generation_93	What it does is it sucks air out of this chamber here. The vacuum is created, which then creates an artificial gravity. So, if we were to go in here, we would be lighter because the air is being sucked away. But if you	When you're vacuuming, you are using a vacuum. You can't vacuum yourself if you're using a vacuum. You can vacuum the house though. So, in the example above, the vacuum was being used but not the vacuum. This is

The concept behind that system is simple. But the technology that makes it work"	We know it is a vacuum because the air pressure inside the bell is the same as that in the surrounding air. Any air pressure difference would make the bell move in or out. The air pressure inside the bell remains the same because the air molecules that
generation_95	It’s similar to the vacuum cleaners used in the ’50s and ’60s, except it uses water instead of air. That’s a nifty trick for removing particulates from the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and mold	You can see the air flowing through it as it sucks up water. The concept is brilliant. The device is simple. How can I make it better? It works. What else can be improved? What can be added? What can be taken away
generation_96	The hot air, in this case, is simply a byproduct of the heat of the sun. There is no combustion, no burning, no gasses. The air that comes out of the hose is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen	It will suck up the dirt as you clean your home.
