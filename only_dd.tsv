73	1010	only		In 1986, a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment. This sport is very challenging. It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance. Especially when descending, as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back, they sway around. The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it. Even if they jump off, they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes. No wonder people give the title' brave' to anyone who jumps off.__eou__You see, the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then, like diving, their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth. The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend. They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord.__eou__Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage.	"A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said, "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform, I was extremely nervous. When I looked down, I was nervous even more. If the cord had broken, I would be knocked to' bakemeat'. However, I knew my worries were unwanted. I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me. I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward. I only felt wind wiring at my ears. My body rapidly descended. I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord. In fact it was 30 seconds. Maybe because of my nervousness, I only felt seven or eight seconds. When rebounding to the high altitude, I felt a sudden sense of relief. I did not feel nervous very much, but very comfortable.

92	1273	only		Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months, what are your general impression of it?__eou__I think, maybe, it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment; meanwhile, I am no more than a beginner. But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life.__eou__You mean, kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined? To some extent your idea holds water. Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense, but with time it became something more than defense skills. Now we are apt to treat it as an art.__eou__An art! You have a good point there. So it is called martial arts in English. The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely. They even made fighting a great enjoyment, so marvelous and fascinating.__eou__Thanks for your compliment! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics. Do you know Jin Yong?__eou__I know he is a martial arts fiction writer. But I've read none of his novels.__eou__All of his works have been translated into English. I recommend you to read one or two works of his. You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture. When you go through the pages, you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone, but cover all walks of life.__eou__I see. They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements.	Yes, take philosophy, for instance. What makes a true, respectable da via, or a warrior hero? It's not enough only to be formidable.

113	1553	only		Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue.__eou__It is true. I think we should change some policies.__eou__Right. Like our LPF program.

Lower-income households, on the other hand, can only get smaller loans, or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing.	Indeed, it's unfair.

You know, some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more.__eou__Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older?__eou__I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned. I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room.	That's very respectable, but I could never live with my parents.

I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me. I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward. I only felt wind wiring at my ears. My body rapidly descended.

142	1911	only		A Westerner said to his Chinese friend. “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup. It’s disgusting. ” The Chinese friend replied, “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating. It’s even worse. ”__eou__Everyone has his own habits, but these habits are not very good. The noise often spoils other people’s appetite.__eou__I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States. Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread. Before each course, the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way. We always said “ American way. ” It’s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners. What is the Chinese way?__eou__The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated. The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate. I assume it is less complicated, right?	Not really. I did some research about Chinese table manners. The important rule is to remain silent while eating. Of course, this refers to family meals only. Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health. It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party. The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated. Each dish should be placed in the correct position. When fish is served, the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty. If it is in winter, the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter. Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table. The diners should sit close to the table so food won’t drop on their cloths. No noise should be made when chewing. No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn’t like it. One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise. All these table manners are very similar to Western habits.	Not really. I did some research about Chinese table manners. The important rule is to remain silent while eating.

Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles. We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people’s appetite.Westerners like to say, “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners. ” Is there such an expression in Chinese?

They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.	Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?	Cool! Is that why we work eight hours now?	Yes!

He likes children and always wants a child of his own.__eou__In fact, they’re both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese.__eou__Oh, right. Now I know why they would want to see our boy. It’s hard to imagine the wonder! Are they expecting a boy or a girl?	It’s still a mystery. Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now.	It’s still a mystery. Because Evelyn is three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now.	Oh! You mean she doesn’t have to work now?

621	7084	only		Do you have much experience with kids?__eou__Yes. I have three sons. Actually I also have a grandson.__eou__To tell you the truth, sometimes I regret having a baby so early. I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby.__eou__I understand. I was in your position before. At that time I couldn’t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.__eou__What about your mother? Did she help you?	Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That’s it. I had to care for them most of the time.	Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit once or twice a week. That’s it. I had to care for them most of the time.	I see. So if my little family goes to America, I would end up taking care of my child all the time. My husband would have to make the bread for us. I just don’t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day.

My exercise, I think, is very hard. I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties. I feel alive!__eou__Oh, I know. I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you.__eou__Yeah, they are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It’s difficult and boring.__eou__It’s true. Many students do the exercise when they have to. We have P. E. once a week.__eou__But I think Chinese students need to exercise more. Besides exercise will help them learn new things better. Don’t students want to have a good memory?	Of course. I didn’t know that. I only know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions?	Of course. I didn’t know that. I know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions?	Well, do what you like to do. It can be anything. Jogging, doing aerobics, going bicycling, and playing ping-pong. Absolutely anything. Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you.

Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain.__eou__But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career?__eou__Yeah, I'd have to say it has. But I'm still paying for it, you know.__eou__I know education is expensive, but it's been my lifelong dream. Call me crazy, but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name.__eou__Well, getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school. Can you afford that? Can you survive that?__eou__I certainly can't afford it, but I'm sure I could find some good student loans.__eou__I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's not as romantic as you might think.__eou__Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate. I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare.	Uh huh, that's for sure. You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students.	Uh huh, that's for sure. You might find that your career choice is teaching other graduate students.

693	7627	only		Alright everyone settle down. Let’s get started.As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system. It is not enough to simply memorize our laws, it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed. This brings me to our topic for today. Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first?__eou__Cinct de mayo?__eou__No, that’s May fifth in Spanish, James, no wonder you are failing my Spanish class. No, May first is International Workers’Day.__eou__Do we get a day off from school then?__eou__No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.__eou__Www, man!__eou__In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.	Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?	Cool! Is that why we work eight hours now?	Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.

It’s all math, really, arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.__eou__Yeah, yeah, but today’s lesson was all about the creation of the universe.__eou__A physics class about the creation of the universe? That’s some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.__eou__It’s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That’s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.__eou__Turtles? Whatever ... Look, all that’s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that’s what the math says.__eou__Math, sheath. What’s the evidence?__eou__There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He’s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang ... DUH!__eou__Anyway, it’s just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where’s the scientific rigor in that?	Dude, don’t equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, didn’t you?	Dude, don’t equivocate. A theory becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing.

Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force.__eou__Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably, I'd guess. I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives.	Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers, because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys. The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite.

Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese.__eou__Oh, right. Now I know why they would want to see our boy. It’s hard to imagine the wonder! Are they expecting a boy or a girl?	It’s still a mystery. Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now.

At that time I couldn’t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.__eou__What about your mother? Did she help you?	Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That’s it. I had to care for them most of the time.	Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit once or twice a week. That’s it. I had to care for them most of the time.	I see. So if my little family goes to America, I would end up taking care of my child all the time.

1025	11019	only		China is now a member of world trade organization. As a member of TO, China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members. Is it fair to China, do you think?__eou__It's a hard question, but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question. After the establishment of new China, our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy. These policies, however, favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises. After China's entry into TO, Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts. This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies. These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run.__eou__We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement. This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise. Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships?	Yes, it does. Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises, regardless of their nationality and ownership. I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous, these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle. Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies.

First, it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects, because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable. Secondly, it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way, because the person doing the survey usually doesn’t have the patience to wait for long feedback. So the way we put up questions must be clear and direct and only by this means can we get accurate data.

1087	12008	only		So tell me, what's the difference between the Board of Directors, the CEO, and the stockholders? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...	No, there's a definite difference. You know, the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system. Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer. He's the hot shot, the main guy who is the boss. If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization, everyone knows that the power will go to their head. It's too dangerous. That's the reason for a Board of Directors. The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry. They could be related to the organization, but more commonly, they are independent and non-biased.	No, there's a definite difference.

As I said in my email, we can help you with production according to your needs, but we will be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis.	Oh, yes. I reviewed your estimate.

1089	12047	only		Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set?__eou__We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers? That will be a large order, probably about two or three cases. The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock.__eou__You can double check with the housekeeping department, but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges. Last time when we made our order to the supplier, the quantity was also especially high. They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us. As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance, they can usually fill the order.__eou__OK, I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure. Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it?	I think the only thing is toner. Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow. We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis. Anyhow, see what you can do to expedite the order this time.

I can’t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely!__eou__No problem, if possible I always combine business with pleasure. Now, let’s hear more about these chocolates you’re offering.__eou__Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They’re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.__eou__Mmmm, sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates, where are they produced? Belgium?__eou__Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.__eou__Really? I didn’t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ...__eou__That’s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They’Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!__eou__Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth ...	Unique, aren’t they? I bet you’Ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one’s cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the creme make it through inspection.

As you know, you’Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week, and this will negativity impact the team’s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.__eou__I know, I’m really sorry that I missed the deadline. But really, it wasn’t my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute, and that I couldn’t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis. You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable, then I wouldn’t have missed my deadline.__eou__Oh, come on! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You’re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues, rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.	No, I’m not trying to pass the buck here; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done. But the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn’t gone down. And you know, with everything I’Ve got going on now, I can’t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems. I’Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ...

I’m not going to accept this excuse. You’re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you’Ve missed your deadline. Look, we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards. No more phoney cases. If you’re in over your head, you tell me. No more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by nine am!

I thought you were pleased with his overall performance. Didn’t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?__eou__Yeah, his attitude is great, but he’s really unreliable.Sometimes he’s really productive, but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance, he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting!__eou__Well, I’m sure he had a perfectly good reason ...	But that’s not the only thing ... you know, he really doesn’t have the best work ethic, I’m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.	But that’s not the thing ... you know, he really doesn’t have the best work ethic, I’m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous?__eou__Yeah, I guess so. I've never actually heard of this one, but ...__eou__Well, it's small, but it's a young, dynamic, rapidly-growing company with a progressive, humanistic philosophy.__eou__You didn't read their brochure or anything, did you?__eou__Four times. I'm totally prepared. Oh, no! I forgot to take off my nail polish! And I have to be there in 15 minutes! That's it. I blew it.__eou__Well, they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish. Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great.

It is really great. I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least. Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing.__eou__So what you are really trying to sell is a fad.__eou__Yes, we would like to make things like key chains, plastic pencil sharpeners, plastic rulers, watches, wallets, things like that.Little accessories for young people. But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty.__eou__I understand. But why won't you show me the logo?__eou__Because it hasn't been copyrighted. We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright, we are investigating companies to produce the products.__eou__I see. The problem, however, is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last.	I understand.

1134	12866	only		Mr. Brown, I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem. I'd like, if possible, to see it settled at this meeting.__eou__What is it, Mrs. Wang?__eou__It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms. They reached us two weeks ago, and were immediately examined after they arrived. To our astonishment, about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms. We can't accept them in this state. They are unfit for human consumption. And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them.__eou__Is that so? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind. Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years. We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten. Have you any evidence?__eou__Certainly. Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London, whose testimony is absolutely reliable.__eou__Though everything may be as you say, there are many factors involved. What's more, your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage.__eou__The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags, sixty of these bags to a carton. It is stated on the surveyor? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact. So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing.__eou__As you know, before shipment, the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question. They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export.	I think the Inspection Bureau at your end, when effecting inspection, only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard. The part that was not dried properly, most probably, escaped their attention. As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment, I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss.

The inspection certificate, which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand, is considered final and binding upon both parties. We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit, because you bought the goods F. O. B. Houston and on shipping quality, not on landed quality. Your claim, in our opinion, should be referred to the insurance company, as the mishap occurred after shipment.

1137	12878	only		Mr. Black, when is the earliest shipment you can make?__eou__In April or early May.__eou__I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us.

The fertilizers must be delivered before April, or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing.	In that case, we will have to improve one month further on the time. Now is Jan. If the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of March, only 2 months are left. The time is too limited.	In that case, we will have to improve one month further on the time. Now is Jan.

1139	12889	only		Well, we've settled the problems of price, quality and quantity. What mode of payment do you wish to employ?__eou__Irrevocable letter of credit, of course. It's the normal terms of payment in international business.__eou__Could you adopt D / A or D / P? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit. That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports, especially for such a huge order.__eou__You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum.__eou__Anyhow, there would be certain bank charges. We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit. It would help me greatly, if you could accept D / A or D / P. It makes no difference to you, but it does to me.	Well. As you understand, the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker’s guarantee. We always ask for L / C for our exports, and the other way around, we pay by L / C for our imports. We only accept L / C for regular orders.	Well.

They are Loco invoice, FOB invoice, CIF invoice and Franco invoice.__eou__What does the price in different kinds of invoices include?

To tell you the truth, your proposal surprised us.__eou__Is that so? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person, so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration. Our firm specializes in this line of business. We have six sales representatives, who are on the road all the time, covering the whole of the European market.__eou__Do you sell direct to shops?__eou__Yes, we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts. We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct, without any middlemen.__eou__Do you keep a stock of these things?__eou__In some cases, such as the wristwatches, which always have a steady market, we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents. Generally, however, we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply. We are paid for our service, of course.__eou__That is, your commission.__eou__Yes, our commission is very reasonable. We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal.__eou__Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission.__eou__The European market is not familiar with your products. You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries. At the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs. A 10 % commission will not leave us much.__eou__According to your estimate, what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill, in round figures, of course?__eou__We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business, as our remuneration increases with the turnover, but we will not guar - ante anything, at least not to begin with.__eou__We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products. But our suggestion to you, Mr. Bergeron, as a preliminary step, is to do a little research into the market ...__eou__Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency?__eou__Mr. Bergeron, you leave us no alternative. We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover. Besides our price is worked out according to the costing. A 10 % commission means an increase in our price. We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect.__eou__Oh, that's just too bad. I intended to make great efforts in selling your products.	Well, we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement. To start the ball rolling, we will provide you with price lists, catalogues and some samples. Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products, can we then discuss further details.

About how many units would you need?__eou__Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units.__eou__Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100. Is that price acceptable to you?__eou__Your estimated is seems a little high to me, we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit.

I didn’t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production__eou__That’s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They’Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!__eou__Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth ...	Unique, aren’t they? I bet you’Ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one’s cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the creme make it through inspection.

1146	12920	only		We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth. The client thinks it's too dark, and they want to add halogen lighting. We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys, do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens?__eou__Oh ... Um ... I don't think so. you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system. Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you. That's not going to come cheap.	But it would only be adding to the existing structure. We're not talking about anything new here ...	But it would be adding to the existing structure. We're not talking about anything new here ...	It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out, and they are union labor. It'll cost you a pretty penny ...
1147	12922	only		I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both. I've thought through a lot of these details, and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon.__eou__Let's get start. What kinds of things do you have in mind? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning, we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement.__eou__Firstly, we'd like to discuss a discounted price. If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders, we can pay in 60 days.__eou__Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do. How about this? We'll give you a discount of 4 %, but you can have 90 days credits.__eou__Well, that might be acceptable, if you handle the insurance fees.__eou__No, you have to take care of the insurance. But we are willing to pay the half transport. Can you accept that?	We cover the insurance and half the transport fee, and only have a discount of 4 %.

Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P?
1149	12935	only		I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem.__eou__I should say it is something we have never come across before.__eou__The Federal Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA as we call it for short, imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States. Over the years, they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers.__eou__In my opinion, overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports.__eou__Ah, there's something in what you're saying. According to the present FDA regulations, the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States.__eou__Why not? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad, and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers. Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are?__eou__I'd be quite willing to if I could, but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law, or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs.__eou__In that case, what can we do to help you? Have you any suggestions?__eou__Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C. I. F. basis for delivery in Hong Kong? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations.	Do you think that's the only way out? You know we usually do the labeling, as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products.	Do you think that's the way out?

1150	12936	only		Mr. Jones, shall we now discuss the packaging?__eou__Very well. You know, we have definite ways of packaging garments. As to blouses, we use a polythene wrapper for each article, all ready for window display.	Good. A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales. With competition from similar garments producers, the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive.	Good. A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales.

We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse.
1151	12939	only		It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods.__eou__And that is?__eou__How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York?__eou__I'm afraid we can't agree to that. We concluded the business with you here in Houston, and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York. We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle. Hong Kong is out of the question.	It's like this. There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka, while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent. If shipment were effected from Hong Kong, we could receive the goods much earlier.	It's like this.

1155	13017	only		I've something very unpleasant to talk with you. Upon the arrival of the first consignment, it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking.__eou__It's rather an unusual case. Have you found the cause of leaking?__eou__It’s simply because the tins were damaged.	It appears to be the only case to us, that the goods have been damaged on the way.

The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling.
1156	13018	only		Man, they take a lot of our paycheck.__eou__Yeah, the government really takes a bite, doesn’t it?	Seriously. The only tax I don’t mind them taking is social security. It’s only a few dollars every paycheck.	Seriously. The tax I don’t mind them taking is social security. It’s a few dollars every paycheck.	Yeah, I don’t mind it either.
