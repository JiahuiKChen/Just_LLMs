506	2425	just		Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck.__eou__You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair.__eou__Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan?__eou__OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay.__eou__Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.__eou__All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.__eou__That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take.__eou__Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level?__eou__That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.__eou__I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan.__eou__No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some explanation.	Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later!	Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I never paid much attention. See you later!	
507	2428	just		Hey, Trev! How did the shopping go?__eou__“ You ain't nothing' but a hound-dog ... ”__eou__Trev, are you OK?	Of course I'm OK! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records!

I took the left over turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and onions, added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches!__eou__Isn't that dangerous though? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated?__eou__Well, I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating. Also, when reheating, I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius.	Well OK, I am just afraid of getting food poisoning.	Well OK, I am afraid of getting food poisoning.

He said she makes really good sushi.__eou__Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let's see. have to be a white wine, of course.__eou__Why? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?__eou__No, I don't think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish.__eou__I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine, right?__eou__Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I'd suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.__eou__Sauvignon Blanc? What's that?	That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.	That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in.

How does it fit?	Hmmm.Not good. They’re too tight.The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it’s pinching my toes. And there’d be no room for my insoles. You know what?

526	2469	just		Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’s get started!__eou__Let’s start with the basics, bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.__eou__Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk about the ingredients! Of course, each person’s palate is different, but I’m going to give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.__eou__Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident — cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs — you can’t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.	Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!

Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time.__eou__So do we have to stay in this English class forever?

When you’re reading, you are just looking, but when you are writing, you are actually doing something!	Oh, now I see what you mean.

Don’t you think so?
992	4009	just		I’Ve always wondered, what’s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students?__eou__I don’t know. What do you think?__eou__I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English, and uses it as a basis for communicating. From start to finish he’s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar. This is a very difficult way to learn.__eou__What do natives get?__eou__They get higher level English, which is more formal than everyday spoken English. They also deal with matters of style and creativity.__eou__Do you mean that a native doesn’t make any mistakes in grammar?__eou__Absolutely not! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes, especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken.__eou__I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don’t know standard English in American universities.	Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think. That’s why it’s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes. Just talk to everyone every chance you get.

What has he done now?__eou__He asked me how long it took me to learn English.__eou__But, you were born and raised in California!__eou__Yeah, but I get that sometimes. It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U. S., we'll always be foreigners in their eyes.__eou__What a racist! How can you stand working with the guy?__eou__You know, Richard isn't such a bad guy. He made the comment out of ignorance, not malice.__eou__So, what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English?	I told him 28 years. And, he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week. He was puzzled for a minute, and then he got it.	I told him 28 years.

996	4021	just		You know, I really don’t think Americans are very romantic.__eou__Where did you get that idea?__eou__That’s the impression I get from the movies, and from looking around.

We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right.__eou__It can be hard, and there are certain sacrifices you have to make.__eou__Like what? I assume that there's no privacy.__eou__That's one. Another is the lack of personal property. Everything you have, from toys to clothes, is used by your brothers and sisters. Especially clothes. Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs.__eou__And the age gap is also annoying. There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me. We have nothing in common.	Same problem here.

After all, he loved me. We went to Bali, Indonesia, one of the most beautiful places in the world. That trip left a very deep impression on him.

But to be perfectly honest, I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team. Are you a diehard football fan?__eou__Oh, certainly. I wouldn't miss a game for the world. My girlfriend says I have an addiction. And actually, if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football.

I can't sleep, I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered. Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak?__eou__You're not weak ... you're stressed out! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years. Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine, that was pretty stressful.	Yeah, but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office. My stress is just about silly paperwork!	Yeah, but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office. My stress is about silly paperwork!	But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors! It's called the flight or fight response. Each time you feel like something's threatening you, your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body.

No way, I am watching that, but I don' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires. It doesn' t make sense.__eou__Of course it does.

It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.__eou__Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they’re so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?

Why do we have to do that?__eou__Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.__eou__I see. That’s convenient! I never understood things like this, such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!	That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing?

I don’t know if you’re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. There’s just too much instability. I wouldn’t feel comfortable investing in this climate.	I don’t know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest.

Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.

Well, I spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother. Anyway, I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave.	Though our company doesn’t have a return policy, limiting the personal use of internet, I don’t think the boss will like us to do that.

This is my first job.__eou__You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college.__eou__Of course! Everyday, there is a deadline to meet.

But sometimes, very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues. It depends on the company’s dress code.	Indeed, I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview. Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony. It seems that their dress code is not that formal. Probably, I should put on car key and simple shirt.	Indeed, I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview.

I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment.__eou__Don’t you think you are overreacting a little? Calling you by nicknames shouldn’t be so bad ...	You’re missing the point. It’s about respect. He treats us with such a patronizing attitude, as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers. It’s his attitude that needs to be changed, not just his words.

Do you think I should use PowerPoint?__eou__You should consider the size and interests of your audience.

Why do we have to do that?__eou__Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth.

Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?__eou__Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man’s eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it’s a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.__eou__I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.__eou__Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It’s a G-rated movie! It’s for the kids! It’s not a thriller!	Well, that’s just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it’s his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It’s just too cliche.	Well, that’s it.

2691	10998	just		What's your ideal boss?	I have had an incredible boss, who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience. A-bout two months after I began working for her, she really let me spread my wings. She encouraged me to work independently, because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment. So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day. Of course, I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports, although she didn't specifically ask me to. Without her support and encouragement, I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time. But she was open to suggestions, so long as employees could back them up with research and facts. When I submitted my suggestion, she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work. She then took my revised proposal to her boss. He was a more conservative type, but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks. He did, and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change. I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs. And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described, I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone.

I'd rather cooperate with everybody else, and get the job done by working together.__eou__What basic principles do you apply to your life?	Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today.

At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, explained my situation, and got their input.	Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job.

3170	12904	just		I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks.__eou__Yes, Mr. Bergeron. You mentioned that in your letter. To tell you the truth, your proposal surprised us.__eou__Is that so? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person, so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration. Our firm specializes in this line of business. We have six sales representatives, who are on the road all the time, covering the whole of the European market.__eou__Do you sell direct to shops?__eou__Yes, we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts. We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct, without any middlemen.__eou__Do you keep a stock of these things?__eou__In some cases, such as the wristwatches, which always have a steady market, we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents. Generally, however, we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply. We are paid for our service, of course.__eou__That is, your commission.__eou__Yes, our commission is very reasonable. We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal.__eou__Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission.__eou__The European market is not familiar with your products. You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries. At the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs. A 10 % commission will not leave us much.__eou__According to your estimate, what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill, in round figures, of course?__eou__We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business, as our remuneration increases with the turnover, but we will not guar - ante anything, at least not to begin with.__eou__We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products. But our suggestion to you, Mr. Bergeron, as a preliminary step, is to do a little research into the market ...__eou__Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency?__eou__Mr. Bergeron, you leave us no alternative. We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover. Besides our price is worked out according to the costing. A 10 % commission means an increase in our price. We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect.	Oh, that's just too bad. I intended to make great efforts in selling your products.	Oh, that's too bad. I intended to make great efforts in selling your products.	Well, we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement. To start the ball rolling, we will provide you with price lists, catalogues and some samples. Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products, can we then discuss further details.
3171	12909	just		Mrs. Wang, would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable?__eou__As I said before, your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid. We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap.	Just to comply, we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent. I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling.	to comply, we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent. I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling.	So do we. Certainly it's a step forward on your side. But the gap is still too wide.
3172	12911	just		So how did I do?__eou__Not too good, I'm sorry.__eou__I lost?__eou__It was close.To be honest, you had the lowest price by three cents per hint, but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner.__eou__So the price was good?	Yes, they loved the price, the delivery date was the problem. They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver, we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery, they might have gone with you.

Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure?__eou__Well, I would need an idea of how large your order would be. About how many units would you need?	Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units.	give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units.	Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100. Is that price acceptable to you?

If you have any questions between now and then, please let me know.__eou__Actually, I did have a question. We'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project. We are hoping to put together a really competitive bid. But at the same time, we'd like to hit your target price, too.__eou__I understand. But unfortunately, it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line. You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals. We also consider other elements, including design and practicality. We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company.__eou__Do you have any price range? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high?	We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint. That's all I can say.	We're looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint. That's all I can say.

One of my coworkers had to give me CPR.__eou__Oh.Jack, I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It' s your gift.__eou__Or a curse.__eou__Nope, it's a gift.Anyway, we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time.__eou__That, my dear, was classic sales technique delivered by a professional.__eou__Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit?__eou__Heck no, we doubled the price, but because it's you, I'll let you have'em at 50 off.	You silver-tongued devil. Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no?	You silver-tongued devil. Can't you ever answer a question with a simple yes or no?	I could, but where's the fun in that?
3176	12916	just		Hello, come in, I've been waiting for you.__eou__Than you, I'm not late, am I?	No, no, no, not at all.It' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you.	No, no, no, not at all.It' s that I've been looking forward to meeting you.	Well, thank you, but it's not all that hard to do, you know. I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now, and you've never responded before.
3177	12927	just		What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price? How do I handle that?	Well, these things happens, I know that. You just have to stay straight with me.	Well, these things happens, I know that. You have to stay straight with me.	Right! So how do I do that? What will make you happy?
3178	12928	just		Well, we've settled the question of price, quality and quantity. Now what about the terms of payment?__eou__We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents.__eou__I see. Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P?__eou__I'm afraid not. We insist on a letter of credit.__eou__To tell you the truth, a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import. When I open a letter of credit with a bank, I have to pay a deposit. That'll tie up my money and increase my cost.__eou__Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum.	Still, there will be bank charges in connection with the credit. It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P. You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit. It makes no great difference to you, but it does to me.

Well, Mrs. Wang, you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee. We always require L / C for our exports.

Do you have a minute?__eou__Sure, what can I do for you?__eou__We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.You know, so we can have the funds put aside.	I'm really busy right now. I got a lot on my plate.So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure?	I'm really busy right now.

3181	12935	just		I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem.__eou__I should say it is something we have never come across before.__eou__The Federal Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA as we call it for short, imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States. Over the years, they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers.	In my opinion, overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports.	In my opinion, overly strict regulations are another way of restricting imports.	Ah, there's something in what you're saying. According to the present FDA regulations, the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States.
3182	12938	just		Well, that was an interesting documentary!__eou__For sure! I didn’t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US.__eou__Like what?__eou__Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K?__eou__Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement. Through a 401K, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan. Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.	That’s interesting and logical I guess. In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don’t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that.

3184	12940	just		Hello, Sir, may I help you?__eou__Yes. I would like some information for requesting a loan.__eou__Very well, here are the general terms of our loan policies. We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.__eou__I see. So let me get this straight. If I borrow let’s say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?__eou__It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate. This of course is considering that you don’t default on a payment!	It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.	It sounds good but, there is one problem. I have a terrible credit score.	That is a very serious problem you see, the bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan.

3219	13087	just		Hello, Sir, may I help you?__eou__Yes. I would like some information for requesting a loan.__eou__Very well, here are the general terms of our loan policies.

If I borrow let’s say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?__eou__It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate. This of course is considering that you don’t default on a payment!	It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.	It sounds good but, there is one problem.
