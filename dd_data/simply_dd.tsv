0	301	simply		What do you think about all the different diets that people go on?__eou__I don't think dieting is good for you. It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with!__eou__But what do you think about people who are obese? What should they do to lose weight?__eou__They need to eat healthy foods, but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day. They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether, though.__eou__So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate, don't you?__eou__Sure, they can eat some chocolate. As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods, there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert.__eou__How about drinking soda?	Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda. Soda should be treated seriously; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever.	Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda.

1	934	simply		You are an early bird, Tom. What do you do in the morning then?__eou__Exercise. The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day. We should not pass them up easily. Seize the time and do something useful.__eou__So, you choose to spend it on bodybuilding. Where do you exercise?__eou__Usually, I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up. Admission is free. Then I start my activities.__eou__Do you do the same exercises every day?	No, I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises; parallel bars, push-ups, sit-ups, bunny-hops, five-kilometer run, and so on. I alternate them over the weekdays. Sometimes, when I find myself in a bad state, I will simply idle about in the park.

4	1513	simply		The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest.__eou__Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much? The same is true in the West.__eou__No, absolutely not! On the contrary, you'll be considered a well-connected, sociable man, if you keep involved in the conversation all the time. But always pay attention to what you say. If the table has a senior guest, say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible. Or maybe, you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested.__eou__You mean, keeping a low profile in the presence of the old? That goes in like with Confucius' preachings, right?__eou__Correct. Show respect for the older people. Conventionally, before the meal starts, the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one. Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite. Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other.__eou__Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest?__eou__Yes, plenty of them. Don't eat fast! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others. And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely.__eou__Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient?	Haha, I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate.	Haha, I'm afraid it's because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate.	
5	1515	simply		In China at least, coffee is often associated with an exotic, well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle. Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated, middle-class people.__eou__Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar, surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop. While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace, they are actually showing off!__eou__Yes. Behind a lifestyle, there is a culture. Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life. While they may not really like coffee, they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places.__eou__Then what about tea? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea, rather than coffee, has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people.	Well. Tea represents another facet of popular culture. While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft, elegant music, a teahouse is often a noisy, crowded, public space. People visit teahouses to associate with others, playing chess, chatting, or simply listening to operas.	Well. Tea represents another facet of popular culture.

What a pity that the traditional teahouses, as depicted by Lao She, keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis. It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either. Teahouses of today all feature a cozy, comfortable environment, and high-quality services, but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar.
