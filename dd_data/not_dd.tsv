196	1010	not		In 1986, a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment. This sport is very challenging. It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance. Especially when descending, as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back, they sway around. The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it. Even if they jump off, they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes. No wonder people give the title' brave' to anyone who jumps off.	You see, the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then, like diving, their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth. The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend. They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord.

To some extent your idea holds water. Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense, but with time it became something more than defense skills. Now we are apt to treat it as an art.

It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither, weigh, calligraphy and painting. I think weigh is the most fantastic of them. It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness.__eou__I know it is quite different from Western chess.__eou__Yes. Playing chess is a very aggressive experience. All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents. Whenever I start a chess game, I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill.__eou__But isn't it the same with wiki?	Certainly not. The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent. In other words, each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board. Hence, chess aims to kill, while weigh is most concerned with howso survive.	Certainly. The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent.

294	1515	not		In China at least, coffee is often associated with an exotic, well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle. Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated, middle-class people.__eou__Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar, surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop.

Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends' homes, their parents would offer me a cup of hot, strong tea, though they never inquired of me about whether I want it.	You've got a point there. It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit. There is no need to ask if he needs it or not, or if he wants something else.

Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines, like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine, alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself.

If I bargain, I might come to a lower price. But I will never know the true price of what I am buying, and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places.

Pull up a chair.__eou__Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan?__eou__OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay.__eou__Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.__eou__All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.__eou__That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take.__eou__Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level?	That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.	That's right. all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.	I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

He said she makes really good sushi.__eou__Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let's see. have to be a white wine, of course.__eou__Why? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?__eou__No, I don't think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish.__eou__I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine, right?	Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I'd suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.	Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm sure it'd be your best bet.

577	2469	not		Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’s get started!__eou__Let’s start with the basics, bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.__eou__Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk about the ingredients! Of course, each person’s palate is different, but I’m going to give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.	Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident — cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs — you can’t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!
578	2471	not		I’m hungry, let’s go grab a bite to eat.__eou__Yeah me too. Oh! Can we stop at the shop really fast?

How much is all this going to cost? I’m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it’s outrageous! This is basically a crayon!	What about you? You spend as much or more money on your razors, after shave, cologne and gel! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...	What about you?

579	2474	not		Hi Cody, how did practicing go this week?__eou__Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn’t get a chance to memorize the second page, but I think I mastered the tricky section.__eou__Great!

582	2478	not		Stephanie! Did you just get to school? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning! That was about an hour and a half ago. This happens all the time! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning?__eou__It’s a skill. What can I say? I don’t know why, I just have a long routine.__eou__Please explain because it makes no sense to me. How can a girl’s routine be so complicated? You get up, you shower, you get dressed, you brush your teeth, you’re out the door. Half an hour, tops.__eou__Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don’t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it’s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes.

One day when i was in a queue, reading a newspaper story, the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding.	Well, that's not rare.

He likes children and always wants a child of his own.__eou__In fact, they’re both very excited about the coming baby.

At that time I couldn’t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.__eou__What about your mother? Did she help you?__eou__Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That’s it. I had to care for them most of the time.__eou__I see. So if my little family goes to America, I would end up taking care of my child all the time. My husband would have to make the bread for us. I just don’t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day.__eou__Don’t worry. You can take night classes. I did that when I had kids. And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten. Then you could find a job and work.	Sounds not so easy to me. When that happens, I will be too old to learn.	Sounds so easy to me.

I don’t have much time to do those things.__eou__Oh, I see. You know, we spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising?__eou__Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, and the other days I play badminton with my husband. I always feel good afterward.__eou__That’s great! I’Ve heard people say that before.__eou__Well, why don’t you try to get some exercise? It’s difficult, but very rewarding.

Football is cool. I usually try to catch the World Cup finals.__eou__No, I'm talking about American football. The World Cup is soccer.__eou__Oh, I understand. I can't say I'm a big fan. I'm from China, and football doesn't have a really big following over there.__eou__So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball?	Yes, I think so. But to be perfectly honest, I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team. Are you a diehard football fan?	Yes, I think so. But to be perfectly honest, I'm really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team. Are you a diehard football fan?	Oh, certainly.

I’m even less experienced than you are.__eou__At least you know what American women generally like in a man.	Believe it or not, I guess American women like a man in good shape, which Chinese women may not care about so much. That’s my honest opinion. I know you have been trying very hard.	Believe it or, I guess American women like a man in good shape, which Chinese women may care about so much. That’s my honest opinion. I know you have been trying very hard.	American men are naturally taller than Chinese men. So even if I exercise, there aren’t many chances.

Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain.__eou__But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career?__eou__Yeah, I'd have to say it has. But I'm still paying for it, you know.__eou__I know education is expensive, but it's been my lifelong dream. Call me crazy, but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name.__eou__Well, getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school. Can you afford that? Can you survive that?__eou__I certainly can't afford it, but I'm sure I could find some good student loans.	I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's not as romantic as you might think.	I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's as romantic as you might think.	Yeah ...

My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them.__eou__What did she tell them? Is she dropping out of college?__eou__Nothing that serious. She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend.__eou__And your parents took it badly?__eou__That's putting it mildly. My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her.__eou__Ouch, that sounds bad. What did your sister do?

When I leave work, it’s always rush hour.So the buses are always crowded.__eou__Oh, yeah, it’s terrible. I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China. It’s when so many people try to get onto one city bus, and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt.	That sounds terrible the way you describe it.

I remember, when I first arrived in Guangzhou, my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone.__eou__Oh, yeah. Many Chinese like to bargain. It happens almost everywhere.__eou__I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, until it seemed to me that they would fight. My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation.__eou__A shouting match? You’re so funny. You must be exaggerating. I don’t believe it.	I am not exaggerating at all. I’m telling you the truth. That was how I felt at that time.	I am exaggerating at all. I’m telling you the truth. That was how I felt at that time.	Yes, perhaps. Chinese usually don’t notice that sort of thing. Maybe it’s quite natural to us.

2119	7850	not		Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley, he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts. It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office. I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it.__eou__He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast. I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California. It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office, so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in.__eou__Maybe so, but it seems kind of strange, which the rest of us in white shirts, dark suites, and ties.	It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers. Besides, didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning?	It's as bad as that ...

2120	7851	not		Even if our company didn't have a dress code, I still think people would wear formal clothing to work.__eou__I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in.	Maybe that's true for some positions, but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree. They dress for success! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans. It's just not respectful to you client.	Maybe that's true for some positions, but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely agree. They dress for success! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans.

2123	7860	not		The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month. Did you put your name in for it?__eou__No, I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless. I mean, how much can you really learn in one afternoon?	It's not just about the things that you learn, you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation. You can learn a few things, but more importantly, you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future. The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway.

2124	7863	not		Management is going through a big turnover these days. With Bill's retirement, and department realignment, we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff. They've been dropping like flies ...__eou__Isn't that a good thing? Having fewer bosses means having less stress, don't you think?__eou__Actually, I don't think so. Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace. They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees. If there is no one to keep an eye on us, no one would get any work done. You know what they say, when the cat's away, the mice play.	You're right, we do need leadership.

I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ...__eou__If they all unite on a certain issue, it's the stockholders who have the final say. You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers, but in fact, the stockholders control the money so they have the most power.__eou__Is it really that simple? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ...	It might not be the most efficient, but if you think about it, it makes pretty good sense. The stockholders are our investors. They own the capital in our company, so they should have say about what is done with the company.	It might be the most efficient, but if you think about it, it makes pretty good sense.

But can’t you try to get used to Western food?__eou__I have tried. But Americans like butter, bread, sugar, and cream too much.__eou__I suppose you’re right, Lee. Maybe that’s why so many Westerners are overweight.	It’s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs, do not take naps during the day, and yet they can be so heavy.

I thought his wife couldn’t have a baby.__eou__Actually they’re expecting the baby to come on my birthday.__eou__Oh, what a coincidence! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it. He likes children and always wants a child of his own.__eou__In fact, they’re both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese.__eou__Oh, right. Now I know why they would want to see our boy. It’s hard to imagine the wonder! Are they expecting a boy or a girl?__eou__It’s still a mystery. Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now.	Oh! You mean she doesn’t have to work now? It’s hard for young parents not to overreact, isn’t it?	Oh! You mean she doesn’t have to work now? It’s hard for young parents to overreact, isn’t it?

I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs.__eou__Why do you say that?__eou__The city is beautiful, the off ..., the offices are modern and comfortable, and the work is so interesting.__eou__Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives. Government service can be a rewarding and secure career.__eou__Do you mean financially rewarding?__eou__Well, many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries.__eou__I’Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy.	Sometimes that’s true, but not usually. Most feds are honest, hard-working professionals. It’s hard to keep highly trained people, so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive.

2134	7889	not		Do you have much experience with kids?__eou__Yes. I have three sons. Actually I also have a grandson.__eou__To tell you the truth, sometimes I regret having a baby so early. I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby.__eou__I understand. I was in your position before. At that time I couldn’t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.__eou__What about your mother? Did she help you?__eou__Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That’s it. I had to care for them most of the time.__eou__I see. So if my little family goes to America, I would end up taking care of my child all the time. My husband would have to make the bread for us. I just don’t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day.__eou__Don’t worry. You can take night classes. I did that when I had kids. And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten. Then you could find a job and work.	Sounds not so easy to me. When that happens, I will be too old to learn.	Sounds so easy to me. When that happens, I will be too old to learn.	No. You see, I went back to school to get my Master’s Degree when I was in my thirties. You won’t be older than that.

And I read sports magazines every week.__eou__Wow!__eou__Do you like sports, Janice?__eou__Oh, yes. I like to exercise. But I don’t watch sports or buy sports magazines. I don’t have much time to do those things.__eou__Oh, I see. You know, we spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising?__eou__Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband. I always feel good afterward.__eou__That’s great! I’Ve heard people say that before.__eou__Well, why don’t you try to get some exercise? It’s difficult, but very rewarding.

Remember to be positive. Sounds good to me.
2139	7900	not		Ok, so who are we going to invite to our dinner party?__eou__Well, we have the Thompsons, the Greens, and the Anderson, about twelve people total.__eou__Don't forget my friend Andy from the office. He has nothing to do on Friday, so I invited him over.__eou__But that makes thirteen people! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday!__eou__Why can't we?__eou__It's an old superstition. If we have thirteen people at the table, then it means bad luck. Can Andy bring a date?	I'm not sure. He just broke up with his girlfriend recently, and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon.	I'm sure.

My parents told me that if I went home, then’d have to find my own place.__eou__You mean they’re kicking you out?	Not really, they just don’t want me living at home.

2142	7907	not		So it is hard to be a black student on campus?__eou__Yes, in many ways it is. There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life.__eou__Stereotypes? Like what?__eou__Well, like since I'm black, I must like rap music, come from the inner city, or play basketball well.__eou__I do know you like rap music, but the other two are definitely false. I’Ve seen you play basketball.	Hey! But that's not the only problem. There's also the affirmative action stigma.	Hey! But that's the only problem. There's also the affirmative action stigma.

It's a $ 500 penalty for littering, so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there.__eou__Why should I do that? It's only a piece of garbage. Why should you care?__eou__Because this is a public place, and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage.	Listen, I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue. It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space. It's not like there's garbage everywhere.

If you give us the agency, that will be more substantial for our cooperation.	To be frank, you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country.

It seems that I have nothing to do, except this.
2881	10724	not		We have settled the question of price, quality and quantity. Now I am calling to talk about the terms of payment. What are your terms of payment?__eou__Well. We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C, payable against shipping documents.__eou__I see.

2885	10746	not		Since China was open to the outside world, its trade forms have become much more flexible. One of these commonly used forms is co-production. Would you please do a bit explanation of it, Mr. Walker?__eou__Well, under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products, for example, machine tools for export. Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts; one party is a Chinese enterprise, the other, an overseas firm. Most probably, the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment, and sometimes, parts and components, while the Chinese enterprises factory building, labor and other resources to the cooperative production. They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract.__eou__I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts, particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China.	Not necessarily. It depends on the contract stipulations. They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located, or even in a third country.	necessarily.

We are trying to give you a favourable one.__eou__What's your price?__eou__150 yuan for each piece.__eou__That's a bit more than I was prepared to pay.__eou__How about 130 yuan?__eou__I offer you 110 yuan.__eou__That's too little. Well, I'll come down to 120 yuan.	All right. I go up to 115 yuan, but not a penny more. Is that acceptable?	All right. I go up to 115 yuan, but a penny more. Is that acceptable?

3008	11232	not		Mr. Dick. Does the recommendation of the university play an important role?__eou__Yes. In fact, the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation. In the long period of cooperation, the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations, they trust each other well. If your university recommends you, you can be approved more easily.__eou__But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same. So I doubt its authority.__eou__More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy.

I have cut the price the minimum. You know our freshener is a patent product, different from other kinds of fresheners.

But sometimes, very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues. It depends on the company’s dress code.	Indeed, I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview. Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony.

I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed. You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts. I just want to let you to know, after this month's performance reviews, I'm recommending you for promotion.__eou__Gosh sir, thank you, sir! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department.	Well, it's not going to be in our department. I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer. There's supervisory spot opening up in financial. I'm turning your name in for it.	Well, it's going to be in our department. I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer.

We need to book the venue, make arrangements for speakers and door prizes, and set up all the activities and accommodations.

We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations.__eou__What's the criteria for staff to attend? Are we only including our management team in this affair? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend?	Lower level employees need not attend. The purpose of this retreat is for training, especially for our management team. We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level. In order to get everyone to jell together, we've got to include some fun. That's the reason for the retreat.

3222	12008	not		So tell me, what's the difference between the Board of Directors, the CEO, and the stockholders? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...__eou__No, there's a definite difference. You know, the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system. Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer. He's the hot shot, the main guy who is the boss. If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization, everyone knows that the power will go to their head. It's too dangerous. That's the reason for a Board of Directors. The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry. They could be related to the organization, but more commonly, they are independent and non-biased.__eou__How many people are on the board of directors?	Usually not more than 15, not less than 10. They meet monthly, quarterly, or biannually to oversee an organization or company. They provide long term planing and vision, and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line.

3224	12010	not		Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department?__eou__Sure, let me take a look ... Personal Information, Education, Experience, Training ... I think you should add another section for language. You speak three languages, so you might as well put that on your resume.__eou__But languages don't have anything to do with engineering. Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field?	Not necessarily. I think people would be impressed by your language abilities. It says something about your level of intellect and experience. Also, I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume.	necessarily.

3225	12017	not		Hello? Ms. Patterson? This is Bill from Workmate calling. I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email, we can help you with production according to your needs, but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis.	Oh, yes. I reviewed your estimate. But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind. Did you get a copy of the specs for this project?	Oh, yes. I reviewed your estimate. But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is quite what we had in mind. Did you get a copy of the specs for this project?

3229	12027	not		A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days. He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it. He recommended me to subscribe to it. What do you say?__eou__I think it is good if we know enough about career planning. We will make wiser choices. What else did he tell you about it?__eou__Well, just something in general, like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals.	Sounds practical! To be honest, sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career. I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker. I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills.	Sounds practical! To be honest, sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career. I am sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker. I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills.	Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do. It seems that you need this course more than I do. I love my current job. If I take this course, I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work. If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships, that will be great. I need these to improve my current work performance.
3230	12028	not		You didn’t show up in the morning meeting. What’s up?__eou__Well, I just came in. I worked overtime yesterday. Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate. So I stayed to double check them. The boss was aware of my very late work of last night. So before he left office, he told me I could come one hour later this morning.__eou__But you still look a little bit tired. What time did you leave?__eou__It was around 1 thirty in the morning. I guess I didn’t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind. I just couldn’t stop thinking about them.	That’s normal after a tense work evening. Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either. Once, I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend. That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later.

3232	12032	not		How long have you been in this company?__eou__I came two years ago after I graduated from college. This is my first job.__eou__You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college.	Of course! Everyday, there is a deadline to meet. Bosses watching and testing me all the time, not liking in college, handed in paper months later and tested on schedule. It is so busy. But anyway, I have been trying my best to be a good employee.

What is your secret?
3233	12033	not		Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing?__eou__How regular?__eou__An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey, the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that.__eou__You are kidding me? It is against the labor law. They should be aware of their rights.__eou__But these people say nothing about that. They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days.	That’s not right, somebody should do something.	That’s right, somebody should do something.	
3234	12035	not		Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work?__eou__Of course! It is the No. 1 stressor in my life. You know job stress has become a very common problem these days. So we must learn to cope with it.__eou__Totally agree. What is your solution?__eou__Well, there are two causes of job stress. One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition. So if we want to manage job stress, both we and the companies should do something. For me, I am trying to balance work and leisure time. You know, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy.__eou__You seem to have a very relaxed outlook.__eou__It is necessary. Positive attitude helps to prevent stress.	But I don’t think we can change our working condition. Anyway, we are not the bosses.	But I don’t think we can change our working condition. Anyway, we are the bosses.	I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them, like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities. Our boss is a smart person.

So don’t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase.__eou__Sure.__eou__By the way, do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy?__eou__No, no one has informed me of that so far, tell me.__eou__Ok, there is no cash advance anymore for short trips. You have to pay out of your own pocket, so save all the receipts from your business trip. And then attach them to your expense account. When you get back, our company will reimburse everything.__eou__I see. What about the maximum purdy and rate, any change?	I am not sure. You can check with the finance department.	I am sure. You can check with the finance department.	I will call them this afternoon, thanks.
3236	12039	not		Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films? They sent it in response to your phone call last week.__eou__If they wanted to say something about my call last week, why didn’t they sand it to me?	I guess they must not have your contact information, so they sent it addressed in care of your department head. Anyhow, they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract.

3237	12041	not		Lucy, I’d like to fix the light in the corridor, it keeps flashing, which drives me crazy. Would you like to help me with the ladder?__eou__Monica, wait a moment. I think we’d better call the repairman to do it.__eou__I think I can handle it by myself.__eou__I’d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company.	I see. If I got hurt when fixing the light, even during office hours, I wouldn’t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility.	I see. If I got hurt when fixing the light, even during office hours, I wouldn’t get compensation from our company since repairing is my responsibility.	Other company rules also need your attention.

Especially, I got my own desk with computer and telephone. Such a great place!__eou__That’s very good. I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful.__eou__What was so bad about it?	Small rooms, small window, a small desk shared by three people. I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work.	Small rooms, small window, a small desk shared by three people. I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure be able to deliver good work.	Sounds bad! Lucky you! You didn’t take that job.

3240	12044	not		Didn’t you punch in this morning, Monica?__eou__Sorry, I don’t know the rule about punching.__eou__That’s ok. I should have told you earlier.

3242	12047	not		Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set?	We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers? That will be a large order, probably about two or three cases. The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock.	We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers? That will be a large order, probably about two or three cases. The office supply store we usually go through might have that many in stock.	You can double check with the housekeeping department, but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges. Last time when we made our order to the supplier, the quantity was also especially high. They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us. As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance, they can usually fill the order.
3243	12053	not		Hello, this is Francis.__eou__Hi, this is Monica. I was wondering when we can work on this financial report.__eou__Today, I am busy all day long.__eou__Shall I see you on Friday morning?	That’s not good for me at all. It’ll have to be another time.

It's for your reference. While you are at it, make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes.__eou__You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself?__eou__Exactly.

3247	12073	not		Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background.__eou__I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field. My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law, where I have been able to apply my paralegal education. I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts. I really love research and analyzing facts. My major in college was English, and as a result, my writing skills are my major strength. I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used.__eou__What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession?	Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job. In my last position, I supported four lawyers, and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week. There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything. I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball. At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, explained my situation, and got their input.	Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job.

3248	12081	not		Hello. Is this Ann?__eou__Yes, it is. Kelly?__eou__Yes, it's me.__eou__Do you have a cold?__eou__No. Worse than that. I have a flu. I'm in bed with a fever.__eou__Oh, no! What about your presentation today?__eou__I'd like to do it, of course. But I just can't. I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it.__eou__I understand. What should I tell Mr. Morley?	Why not just tell him I'm sick? I'll ring him myself this afternoon.	Why just tell him I'm sick? I'll ring him myself this afternoon.	Alright. Have you been to see a doctor?
3249	12082	not		Excuse me, sir, this is the express check-out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer. It looks like you have more than fifteen items there.__eou__Oh, come on! I have sixteen items! Cut me some slack, will ya?__eou__Fine! Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through. Do you prefer paper or plastic?__eou__Plastic.

I guess it’s just my day. Thanks anyway.	Do you have a club card or will it be cash?
3250	12083	not		And so, I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project. As you know, you’Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week, and this will negativity impact the team’s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.__eou__I know, I’m really sorry that I missed the deadline. But really, it wasn’t my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute, and that I couldn’t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis. You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable, then I wouldn’t have missed my deadline.__eou__Oh, come on! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You’re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues, rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.	No, I’m not trying to pass the buck here; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done. But the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn’t gone down. And you know, with everything I’Ve got going on now, I can’t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems. I’Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ...

And you know, with everything I’Ve got going on now, I can’t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems. I’Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ...	I’m not going to accept this excuse. You’re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you’Ve missed your deadline. Look, we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards. No more phoney cases. If you’re in over your head, you tell me. No more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by nine am!
3251	12099	not		Have you found a new job yet?	No, not yet. I’m still looking. I’Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though.	No, yet. I’m still looking. I’Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though.	What kind of work?
3252	12100	not		Very good. Now, I have a couple of final questions.	I hope they’re not too hard!	I hope they’re too hard!	Well, why should we hire you?
3253	12103	not		Okay, so let’s go over everything one more time. I really want you to get this job!__eou__I know! It’s an amazing growth opportunity! They’re true industry leaders, and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development.__eou__So, let’s see, you did your research on the company, right?__eou__Well, I visited their website and read up on what they do. They’re an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations. They provide services such as ARM development, and they also offer customdesigned applications.__eou__So what would your role in the company?__eou__Well, the position is for an account manager. That basically means that I would be the link between our and our development team.__eou__Sounds good, and so, why do you want to work with them?__eou__Well, as I said they’re the industry leaders, they have a really great growth strategy, amazing development opportunities for employees, and it seems like they have strong corporate governance. They’re all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential. I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me. Oh, and they offer six weeks’vacation, stock options and bonuses ... I’m totally going to cash in on that.	You idiot! Don’t say that! Do you want this job, or not?	You idiot! Don’t say that! Do you want this job, or?	
3254	12105	not		So, Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative, Jason Huntley.__eou__Sure, what’s up?__eou__Basically, I’Ve got a few concerns about him, and the bottom line is, I don’t think he’s a good fit for our company.__eou__Okay ... what makes you say that? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance. Didn’t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?__eou__Yeah, his attitude is great, but he’s really unreliable.Sometimes he’s really productive, but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance, he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting!__eou__Well, I’m sure he had a perfectly good reason ...	But that’s not the only thing ... you know, he really doesn’t have the best work ethic, I’m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.	But that’s the only thing ... you know, he really doesn’t have the best work ethic, I’m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

They are unfit for human consumption. And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them.__eou__Is that so? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind. Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years. We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten. Have you any evidence?__eou__Certainly. Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London, whose testimony is absolutely reliable.	Though everything may be as you say, there are many factors involved. What's more, your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage.	Though everything may be as you say, there are many factors involved. What's more, your surveyors have mentioned any cause for the damage.	The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags, sixty of these bags to a carton.

So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing.

Everyone in the trade knows that US’s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries.__eou__I agree that yours are of better quality. But there’s competition from synthetic products, too. You can’t very well ignore that. Prices for synthetic bristles haven’t changed much over the years.	There’s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses. That’s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones.

You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement.__eou__I'm glad you're satisfied with our work. I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products.__eou__Yes, we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos. We can see you are experienced in this particular line.__eou__Thank you.__eou__But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative. After all, you sold around 400 pieces there last year. You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end.__eou__That is the result of our hard work. Well, what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then?__eou__500 pieces.__eou__No, no. That's too big a number to be acceptable. Let's put it at 450 pieces. And we'll strive to sell more, of course. We wish to add another clause. For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota, we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts.__eou__All right, let's fix it at 450 pieces then. And for every additional 50 pianos sold, we'll give you 1 % higher commission.__eou__I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged.__eou__We would like to make a specific mention of one more point. As our sole distributor, you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own.	No, certainly not. That's a reasonable restriction.	No, certainly. That's a reasonable restriction.	Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products.
3490	12904	not		I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks.__eou__Yes, Mr. Bergeron. You mentioned that in your letter. To tell you the truth, your proposal surprised us.__eou__Is that so? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person, so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration. Our firm specializes in this line of business. We have six sales representatives, who are on the road all the time, covering the whole of the European market.__eou__Do you sell direct to shops?__eou__Yes, we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts. We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct, without any middlemen.__eou__Do you keep a stock of these things?__eou__In some cases, such as the wristwatches, which always have a steady market, we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents. Generally, however, we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply. We are paid for our service, of course.__eou__That is, your commission.__eou__Yes, our commission is very reasonable. We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal.__eou__Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission.	The European market is not familiar with your products. You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries. At the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs. A 10 % commission will not leave us much.	The European market is familiar with your products. You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries.

A 10 % commission will leave us much.	According to your estimate, what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill, in round figures, of course?
3491	12905	not		This is our rock - bottom price, Mr. Li. We can't make any further concessions.	If that's the case, there's not much point in further discussion. We might as well call the whole deal off.	If that's the case, there's much point in further discussion. We might as well call the whole deal off.	What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price. The gap is too great.
3492	12906	not		First of all, I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country. I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us.__eou__We've been looking forward to your visit. It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest. It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face.__eou__I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers. The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market.__eou__We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too.__eou__I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers. This tends to complicate my business. As you know, I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line. I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come. One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years. As it is to our mutual interests and profit, I am sure you'll have no objection to it.	We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers. As you know, the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial. However, according to our records, the total amount of your order last year was moderate, which does not warrant an agency appointment. Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent.	We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers.

3493	12909	not		Mrs. Wang, would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable?__eou__As I said before, your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid. We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap.__eou__Just to comply, we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent. I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling.__eou__So do we. Certainly it's a step forward on your side. But the gap is still too wide.__eou__The ball is in your court, Mrs.Wang. What price would you suggest?__eou__To make your offer workable, I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken.__eou__That won't do. You see, our profit margin is very narrow. It simply can't stand such a big cut.__eou__I hate to disappoint you, Mr. Brown, but if that's the case, we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere. Do think it over, please. We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion.	Well, I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction. Would you mind waiting a day or two, until I get a reply from the home office?	Well, I'm authorized to agree to such a big reduction. Would you mind waiting a day or two, until I get a reply from the home office?	Not at all. Shall we meet again, say, on Friday morning?
3494	12911	not		So how did I do?	Not too good, I'm sorry.	too good, I'm sorry.	I lost?
3495	12914	not		You got our email with all the specifications for the project. We'll be accepting bids untill noon on Tuesday. If you have any questions between now and then, please let me know.__eou__Actually, I did have a question. We'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project. We are hoping to put together a really competitive bid. But at the same time, we'd like to hit your target price, too.	I understand. But unfortunately, it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line. You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals. We also consider other elements, including design and practicality. We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company.	I understand.

3496	12916	not		Hello, come in, I've been waiting for you.	Than you, I'm not late, am I?	Than you, I'm late, am I?	No, no, no, not at all.It' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you.
3497	12920	not		We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth. The client thinks it's too dark, and they want to add halogen lighting. We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys, do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens?	Oh ... Um ... I don't think so. you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system. Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you. That's not going to come cheap.	Oh ... Um ... I don't think so. you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system.

3498	12924	not		That was a beautiful car. It’s a new car, but it’s totaled.__eou__Well, your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it. So you don’t need to worry.	I don’t think I could afford that kind of car again. I think I’ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace.	I don’t think I could afford that kind of car again. I think I’ll have to choose something that is as hard to replace.	Since you are not the one who caused the accident, your insurance cost should be the same.
3499	12926	not		Do you think I should turn down his offer?__eou__Yes, it's the correct thing to do.	But we may not get another partner.	But we may get another partner.	Even so, we can't do business with him.he' s not reliable.
3500	12927	not		What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price? How do I handle that?__eou__Well, these things happens, I know that. You just have to stay straight with me.__eou__Right! So how do I do that? What will make you happy?	Well, I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy, not you.	Well, I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy, you.	Excuse me?
3501	12928	not		Well, we've settled the question of price, quality and quantity. Now what about the terms of payment?__eou__We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents.__eou__I see. Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P?	I'm afraid not. We insist on a letter of credit.	I'm afraid. We insist on a letter of credit.	To tell you the truth, a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import. When I open a letter of credit with a bank, I have to pay a deposit. That'll tie up my money and increase my cost.
3502	12929	not		Hi, Bill. It's Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd. How are you?__eou__Hello, Marsha, I haven't heard from you in a long time. I'm great, and you?	Not too bad at all. Do you have a minute?	too bad at all. Do you have a minute?	Sure, what can I do for you?
3503	12930	not		Mrs. Miller, you are an old friend of ours. In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship, we are prepared to cut our price by 5 %. Will that satisfy you?__eou__That's great. Thank you for making this concession. I accept.__eou__Now I repeat, 5,000 transistor sets, specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C. I. F. Los Angeles.__eou__Good. Now that the price is decided on, we can discuss the packaging.__eou__As to packaging, we'll pack them two dozens to one carton, gross weight about 25 kilos a carton.__eou__Carton?__eou__Yes, corrugated cardboard boxes.__eou__Could you use wooden cases instead?__eou__Why use wooden cases?	I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation.	I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are strong enough for ocean transportation.	Cartons are comparatively light, and there fore easy to handle. They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo. Besides, we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps.
3504	12932	not		To get around your difficulty, Mr. Brown, I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half. You can send in an Addi trional order later.__eou__Well, I'll consider the possibility. By the way, when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June?__eou__A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered.__eou__Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly?__eou__Getting the goods ready, making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time, you know. You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month.	Very well, Mrs.Wang. I'll not reduce my order. I'll take the full quantity you offer. And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home.	Very well, Mrs.Wang. I'll reduce my order. I'll take the full quantity you offer. And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home.	When will that be?
3505	12935	not		I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem.__eou__I should say it is something we have never come across before.__eou__The Federal Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA as we call it for short, imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States. Over the years, they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers.__eou__In my opinion, overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports.__eou__Ah, there's something in what you're saying. According to the present FDA regulations, the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States.	Why not? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad, and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers. Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are?	Why? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad, and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers. Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are?	I'd be quite willing to if I could, but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law, or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs.
3506	12936	not		Mr. Jones, shall we now discuss the packaging?__eou__Very well. You know, we have definite ways of packaging garments. As to blouses, we use a polythene wrapper for each article, all ready for window display.	Good. A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales. With competition from similar garments producers, the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive.	Good. A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales. With competition from similar garments producers, the merchandise must only be good value but also look attractive.	Right you are. We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse.
3507	12939	not		It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods.__eou__And that is?__eou__How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York?__eou__I'm afraid we can't agree to that. We concluded the business with you here in Houston, and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York. We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle. Hong Kong is out of the question.__eou__It's like this. There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka, while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent. If shipment were effected from Hong Kong, we could receive the goods much earlier.__eou__I see. You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong, where they can be transshipped. Is that the idea?__eou__Yes, exactly, because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date.__eou__Your idea may be a good one, but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong. How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network? You may choose either one as port of shipment. It makes no difference to us. There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York.__eou__It sounds all right to me, but I will have to think about it. I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow. If I choose Seattle, will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March?	We'll try our best. Anyway, we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April.	We'll try our best. Anyway, we assure you that shipment will be made later than the first half of April.	
3508	12964	not		Hey, son, are you insured?	Not yet, but I'm thinking of it. Have you bought one, Dad?	yet, but I'm thinking of it. Have you bought one, Dad?	I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary.
3509	12965	not		Good morning. How can I help you?__eou__I'd like to open a new account.__eou__Have you filled out an application form?__eou__Yes. And I've brought some documents along with me, too. Do you need to see my passport?__eou__Yes. I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step. Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account?__eou__Yes. Does the checking account come with a debit card?__eou__Yes. Actually, both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines, so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction.__eou__That's very convenient.__eou__It is. Our customers really like it. Do you have any other questions about your new accounts?__eou__Yes. What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft?__eou__The maximum is $ 1000.__eou__Is there a penalty for having an overdraft?	Yes, but it's not much. You just have to pay 1 % interest on the account. It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards.	Yes, but it's much. You just have to pay 1 % interest on the account. It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards.	That's true. Is everything alright with my documents?
3510	12984	not		Can you change American dollars into French francs?__eou__Yes. How much do you want?__eou__Fifty dollars. What is the exchange rate today?__eou__One dollar to five francs. Is that all right?__eou__Yes, please. And you can cash my traveler's check, can't you?__eou__Of course, we can.__eou__I want to be here tomorrow. What are your business hours?__eou__10 o'clock in the morning to 2 o'clock in the afternoon.__eou__Thank you.	Not at all.	at all.	
3511	12991	not		Bill, I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival. But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price, for my business is fairly new. I hope that you can make me an advance on loan.__eou__Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security?__eou__No. I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation. You may inspect my accounts. From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations.	We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security. This is a common regulation. But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor.	We do allow any request for a loan against personal security. This is a common regulation. But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor.	Yes, I can. You know Mr. Macready, the famous car dealer here in New York. He agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of US $ l0, 000 until the end of this year.
3512	13000	not		May I help you, Miss?__eou__Yes, I'm excited to hear about your new product.__eou__OK. I'm sure you will love what this new automatic answering system can do for your business.__eou__Yes. I've heard a lot about it.__eou__Watch our computer demonstration, please. You'll be convinced that our product is superior. ( After the demonstration )__eou__Yes, I would have to agree with you. It seems to offer more options than the others. But new product sometimes has a few troubles. How about yours?__eou__Our systems are 100 % trouble-free.__eou__How do you ensure quality?__eou__Any of our new products shall go through a 1-3 month testing period.__eou__Are your prices negotiable?	Yes, our prices are negotiable, but our quality is not.	Yes, our prices are negotiable, but our quality is.	What happens if I am not satisfied with my purchases?
3513	13003	not		Good afternoon, what can I do for you?__eou__I want to draw some money from my current account.__eou__How much do you want to draw?__eou__Well, I want to draw out 4,000 yuan.__eou__OK! Do you take your bank card or bankbook with you?__eou__Yes! Here is my bankbook.__eou__OK. Please fill out this form first.__eou__Yes. Do I need to sign my name here?__eou__Sure. How do you want it?__eou__Well, I want 1,000 yuan in traveler's checks and the rest in cash.__eou__All right. Here are the traveler's checks and money.__eou__Thanks a lot.	Not at all.	at all.

3515	13012	not		I'm here to open a Current Account with your bank.__eou__That's no problem at all, but could you fill in this and I'll need to see some ID.__eou__Here you go. Is there a minimum amount I need to pay in?__eou__Yes, there needs to be at least 1 RIB paid in to open a new account. Also, you will need to choose a secret identity code to ensure no one else can enter your account.	OK, how long does it need to be? I'm not very good with remembering long numbers.

Upon the arrival of the first consignment, it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking.__eou__It's rather an unusual case. Have you found the cause of leaking?__eou__It’s simply because the tins were damaged.__eou__It appears to be the only case to us, that the goods have been damaged on the way.
