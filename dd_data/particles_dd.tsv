506	2425	just		Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck.__eou__You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair.__eou__Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan?__eou__OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay.__eou__Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.__eou__All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.__eou__That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take.__eou__Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level?__eou__That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.__eou__I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan.__eou__No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some explanation.	Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later!	Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I never paid much attention. See you later!	
507	2428	just		Hey, Trev! How did the shopping go?__eou__“ You ain't nothing' but a hound-dog ... ”__eou__Trev, are you OK?	Of course I'm OK! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records!

I took the left over turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and onions, added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches!__eou__Isn't that dangerous though? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated?__eou__Well, I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating. Also, when reheating, I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius.	Well OK, I am just afraid of getting food poisoning.	Well OK, I am afraid of getting food poisoning.

He said she makes really good sushi.__eou__Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let's see. have to be a white wine, of course.__eou__Why? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?__eou__No, I don't think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish.__eou__I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine, right?__eou__Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I'd suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.__eou__Sauvignon Blanc? What's that?	That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.	That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in.

How does it fit?	Hmmm.Not good. They’re too tight.The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it’s pinching my toes. And there’d be no room for my insoles. You know what?

526	2469	just		Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’s get started!__eou__Let’s start with the basics, bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.__eou__Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk about the ingredients! Of course, each person’s palate is different, but I’m going to give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.__eou__Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident — cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs — you can’t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.	Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!

990	4005	just		How long will it take to learn English? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time?__eou__It’s hard to say. Language isn’t like other studies.__eou__You mean I could finish this course and still not know English? You’Ve got to be kidding!__eou__I’m not kidding. Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time.__eou__So do we have to stay in this English class forever?	No. You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation. Then you go on practicing and learning outside. A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation.	No. You have to stay here long enough to get some orientation. Then you go on practicing and learning outside. A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation.	So it’s really the same story.

In writing you have to produce language, you have to create your own words on a blank page.	Oh, now I see what you mean. When you’re reading, you are just looking, but when you are writing, you are actually doing something!	Oh, now I see what you mean. When you’re reading, you are looking, but when you are writing, you are actually doing something!	A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge. Don’t you think so?
992	4009	just		I’Ve always wondered, what’s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students?__eou__I don’t know. What do you think?__eou__I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English, and uses it as a basis for communicating. From start to finish he’s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar. This is a very difficult way to learn.__eou__What do natives get?__eou__They get higher level English, which is more formal than everyday spoken English. They also deal with matters of style and creativity.__eou__Do you mean that a native doesn’t make any mistakes in grammar?__eou__Absolutely not! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes, especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken.__eou__I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don’t know standard English in American universities.	Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think. That’s why it’s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes. Just talk to everyone every chance you get.

I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China, but ...__eou__What is it?	Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others.	Some of my Chinese colleagues share their personal stories in front of others.	That makes you feel uncomfortable?
995	4020	just		What were you and Richard talking about earlier? It looked intense.__eou__Yeah, Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate.__eou__Oh, no. I know how insensitive he can be. What has he done now?__eou__He asked me how long it took me to learn English.__eou__But, you were born and raised in California!__eou__Yeah, but I get that sometimes. It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U. S., we'll always be foreigners in their eyes.__eou__What a racist! How can you stand working with the guy?__eou__You know, Richard isn't such a bad guy. He made the comment out of ignorance, not malice.__eou__So, what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English?	I told him 28 years. And, he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week. He was puzzled for a minute, and then he got it.	I told him 28 years. And, he knows I'm 28 years old since I celebrated my birthday last week. He was puzzled for a minute, and then he got it.	Are you sure he really got the message?
996	4021	just		You know, I really don’t think Americans are very romantic.__eou__Where did you get that idea?__eou__That’s the impression I get from the movies, and from looking around. Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other.__eou__Well, I’m still not sure what you’re asking me.__eou__Is it true or isn’t it?__eou__Do you want to know something about the American character?	I just think you’re trying to change the subject. But go ahead.	I think you’re trying to change the subject. But go ahead.	No, this will help answer your question. In American society boys and girls are raised together. They’re not segregated in their activities! Boys and girls go out together from an early age.
997	4027	just		Are there many idioms in English?__eou__There are hundreds and hundreds. English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions.__eou__Can you give us an example?__eou__I'll look up the rate. To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof. It means to search for and find some information.__eou__What about the expression Goodbye? Is that an idiom?	That is just a natural, grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.	That is a natural, grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.	This is interesting, Ms.Parker.
998	4033	just		How do I buy my textbooks?__eou__Do you have your book list for your class?__eou__Yes, I have my list.__eou__Fine. Once you have it, you can go to the bookstore.

Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there?__eou__No, I didn't know I could do that.	You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door. Do you think you will be going there today?	You take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man outside the door. Do you think you will be going there today?	Yes, I am going today.

My father was an only child, and didn't really care about having a large family, but my mother talked him into it.__eou__Jeez, seven children. That must have a lot of problems. We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right.__eou__It can be hard, and there are certain sacrifices you have to make.__eou__Like what? I assume that there's no privacy.__eou__That's one. Another is the lack of personal property. Everything you have, from toys to clothes, is used by your brothers and sisters. Especially clothes. Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs.__eou__And the age gap is also annoying. There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me. We have nothing in common.	Same problem here. There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family. The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college.	Same problem here.

After all, he loved me. We went to Bali, Indonesia, one of the most beautiful places in the world. That trip left a very deep impression on him. Since then whenever we have holidays and money, we’d like to patronize the travel agency. Isn’t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life?

I'm from China, and football doesn't have a really big following over there.__eou__So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball?__eou__Yes, I think so. But to be perfectly honest, I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team. Are you a diehard football fan?__eou__Oh, certainly. I wouldn't miss a game for the world. My girlfriend says I have an addiction. And actually, if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football.	It seems Americans are very passionate about sports. Is this just a part of your culture?	It seems Americans are very passionate about sports. Is this a part of your culture?	Oh, yeah!

I can't sleep, I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered. Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak?__eou__You're not weak ... you're stressed out! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years. Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine, that was pretty stressful.	Yeah, but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office. My stress is just about silly paperwork!	Yeah, but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office. My stress is about silly paperwork!	But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors! It's called the flight or fight response. Each time you feel like something's threatening you, your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body.

No way, I am watching that, but I don' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires. It doesn' t make sense.__eou__Of course it does. It' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. You can see a couple who are in love but can' t be together because they are so different. And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it! Plus the cast is hip, young people that make the movie even more enticing.	I don' t buy into that.

This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.__eou__No, it’s not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.__eou__Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they’re so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?

Why do we have to do that?__eou__Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.__eou__I see. That’s convenient! I never understood things like this, such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!	That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, then we were in China Standard Time, and that’s eight time zones east of Greenwich!	That stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing?

I think that’s where you’re going wrong.__eou__Why? If I eat less, then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, right?__eou__Not really.

I don’t know if you’re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. There’s just too much instability. I wouldn’t feel comfortable investing in this climate.	I don’t know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest.

Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.

It's nice to see some improvement for a change.__eou__Do you see the trend continuing over the next few months?__eou__Yes, especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to Japan. The only problem is, they may have trouble when they go to open up business here.__eou__Why would you say that?__eou__They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan. There are a lot of cultural differences to account for.	I'll say! Sometimes they just do things really differently. But one thing I can say, they are really hospitable.	I'll say!

Well, something in general, like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals.	Sounds practical! To be honest, sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career. I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker. I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills.

Well, I spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother. Anyway, I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave.	Though our company doesn’t have a return policy, limiting the personal use of internet, I don’t think the boss will like us to do that.
1963	8108	just		How long have you been in this company?__eou__I came two years ago after I graduated from college. This is my first job.__eou__You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college.__eou__Of course! Everyday, there is a deadline to meet.

What is your secret?	It is so encouraging to hear this remark. The secret is to make plans. Write down your goals, short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month.

But sometimes, very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues. It depends on the company’s dress code.	Indeed, I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview. Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony. It seems that their dress code is not that formal. Probably, I should put on car key and simple shirt.	Indeed, I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview.

This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment.__eou__What happened? Did your boss say something to offend you at work?__eou__He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out, referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling. I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment.__eou__Don’t you think you are overreacting a little? Calling you by nicknames shouldn’t be so bad ...	You’re missing the point. It’s about respect. He treats us with such a patronizing attitude, as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers. It’s his attitude that needs to be changed, not just his words.	You’re missing the point. It’s about respect. He treats us with such a patronizing attitude, as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers. It’s his attitude that needs to be changed, not his words.	That’s what you get for working in a male-dominated field. I think you’ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way. You probably won’t be able to change him.

I thought they just paint it on your skin or something.	Oh, I didn’t know that! I thought they paint it on your skin or something.

You always give such amazing presentations, I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow.__eou__Sure, it's easy. First of all, the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple. People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans. Stick to about three or four points, give an overview of the points, then present them one by one, and then summarize at the end. Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered.__eou__What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation? Do you think I should use PowerPoint?__eou__You should consider the size and interests of your audience. In other words, who is listening, and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention, but be careful not to go overboard.	I think I can put something together, no problem. But when it comes to tomorrow, I'll just be a bundle of nerves! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public?

Why do we have to do that?__eou__Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth.

Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?__eou__Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man’s eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it’s a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.__eou__I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.__eou__Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It’s a G-rated movie! It’s for the kids! It’s not a thriller!	Well, that’s just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it’s his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It’s just too cliche.	Well, that’s it.

2691	10998	just		What's your ideal boss?	I have had an incredible boss, who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience. A-bout two months after I began working for her, she really let me spread my wings. She encouraged me to work independently, because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment. So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day. Of course, I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports, although she didn't specifically ask me to. Without her support and encouragement, I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time. But she was open to suggestions, so long as employees could back them up with research and facts. When I submitted my suggestion, she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work. She then took my revised proposal to her boss. He was a more conservative type, but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks. He did, and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change. I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs. And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described, I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone.

I'd rather cooperate with everybody else, and get the job done by working together.__eou__What basic principles do you apply to your life?	Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today. I've found out that time and money get away very easily — you think you have them, and they're gone! Putting things off just makes it worse later, so even if it's hard at the time, I try to get things done that day and not let them go.	Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today.

At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, explained my situation, and got their input.	Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job.

Of course, we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies.	I see. So, that would mean that every month it would just come from my account? That does sound like a good idea, totally trouble free.	I see. So, that would mean that every month it would come from my account? That does sound like a good idea, totally trouble free.

The machine gives you an edge over your competitors, I guess.
3170	12904	just		I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks.__eou__Yes, Mr. Bergeron. You mentioned that in your letter. To tell you the truth, your proposal surprised us.__eou__Is that so? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person, so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration. Our firm specializes in this line of business. We have six sales representatives, who are on the road all the time, covering the whole of the European market.__eou__Do you sell direct to shops?__eou__Yes, we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts. We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct, without any middlemen.__eou__Do you keep a stock of these things?__eou__In some cases, such as the wristwatches, which always have a steady market, we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents. Generally, however, we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply. We are paid for our service, of course.__eou__That is, your commission.__eou__Yes, our commission is very reasonable. We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal.__eou__Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission.__eou__The European market is not familiar with your products. You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries. At the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs. A 10 % commission will not leave us much.__eou__According to your estimate, what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill, in round figures, of course?__eou__We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business, as our remuneration increases with the turnover, but we will not guar - ante anything, at least not to begin with.__eou__We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products. But our suggestion to you, Mr. Bergeron, as a preliminary step, is to do a little research into the market ...__eou__Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency?__eou__Mr. Bergeron, you leave us no alternative. We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover. Besides our price is worked out according to the costing. A 10 % commission means an increase in our price. We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect.	Oh, that's just too bad. I intended to make great efforts in selling your products.	Oh, that's too bad. I intended to make great efforts in selling your products.	Well, we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement. To start the ball rolling, we will provide you with price lists, catalogues and some samples. Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products, can we then discuss further details.
3171	12909	just		Mrs. Wang, would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable?__eou__As I said before, your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid. We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap.	Just to comply, we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent. I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling.	To comply, we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent. I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling.	So do we. Certainly it's a step forward on your side. But the gap is still too wide.
3172	12911	just		So how did I do?__eou__Not too good, I'm sorry.__eou__I lost?__eou__It was close.To be honest, you had the lowest price by three cents per hint, but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner.__eou__So the price was good?	Yes, they loved the price, the delivery date was the problem. They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver, we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery, they might have gone with you.

They didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver, we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery, they might have gone with you.	So I didn't miss by much then.
3173	12912	just		How much will our order from your factory be?__eou__I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days.__eou__I'm afraid I can't wait that long. Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure?__eou__Well, I would need an idea of how large your order would be. About how many units would you need?	Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units.	Give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units.	Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100. Is that price acceptable to you?
3174	12914	just		You got our email with all the specifications for the project. We'll be accepting bids untill noon on Tuesday. If you have any questions between now and then, please let me know.__eou__Actually, I did have a question. We'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project. We are hoping to put together a really competitive bid. But at the same time, we'd like to hit your target price, too.__eou__I understand. But unfortunately, it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line. You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals. We also consider other elements, including design and practicality. We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company.__eou__Do you have any price range? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high?	We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint. That's all I can say.	We're looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint. That's all I can say.	
3175	12915	just		Donna! How are you? It's good to hear your voice.__eou__Thank you. Jack, it's always a pleasure doing business with you.__eou__So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave?__eou__Great! And, how are things in your neck of the woods?__eou__Things are so great here. I almost smiled myself to death last week. One of my coworkers had to give me CPR.__eou__Oh.Jack, I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It' s your gift.__eou__Or a curse.__eou__Nope, it's a gift.Anyway, we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time.__eou__That, my dear, was classic sales technique delivered by a professional.__eou__Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit?__eou__Heck no, we doubled the price, but because it's you, I'll let you have'em at 50 off.	You silver-tongued devil. Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no?	You silver-tongued devil. Can't you ever answer a question with a simple yes or no?	I could, but where's the fun in that?
3176	12916	just		Hello, come in, I've been waiting for you.__eou__Than you, I'm not late, am I?	No, no, no, not at all.It' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you.	No, no, no, not at all.It' s that I've been looking forward to meeting you.	Well, thank you, but it's not all that hard to do, you know. I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now, and you've never responded before.
3177	12927	just		What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price? How do I handle that?	Well, these things happens, I know that. You just have to stay straight with me.	Well, these things happens, I know that. You have to stay straight with me.	Right! So how do I do that? What will make you happy?
3178	12928	just		Well, we've settled the question of price, quality and quantity. Now what about the terms of payment?__eou__We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents.__eou__I see. Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P?__eou__I'm afraid not. We insist on a letter of credit.__eou__To tell you the truth, a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import. When I open a letter of credit with a bank, I have to pay a deposit. That'll tie up my money and increase my cost.__eou__Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum.	Still, there will be bank charges in connection with the credit. It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P. You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit. It makes no great difference to you, but it does to me.

It makes no great difference to you, but it does to me.	Well, Mrs. Wang, you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee. We always require L / C for our exports. And the other way round, we pay by L / C for our imports.
3179	12929	just		Hi, Bill. It's Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd. How are you?__eou__Hello, Marsha, I haven't heard from you in a long time. I'm great, and you?__eou__Not too bad at all. Do you have a minute?__eou__Sure, what can I do for you?__eou__We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.You know, so we can have the funds put aside.	I'm really busy right now. I got a lot on my plate.So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure?	I'm really busy right now.

We have a showroom on the ground floor. Let's go downstairs and have a look.
3181	12935	just		I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem.__eou__I should say it is something we have never come across before.__eou__The Federal Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA as we call it for short, imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States. Over the years, they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers.	In my opinion, overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports.	In my opinion, overly strict regulations are another way of restricting imports.	Ah, there's something in what you're saying. According to the present FDA regulations, the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States.
3182	12938	just		Well, that was an interesting documentary!__eou__For sure! I didn’t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US.__eou__Like what?__eou__Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K?__eou__Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement. Through a 401K, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan. Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.	That’s interesting and logical I guess. In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don’t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that.

In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don’t really trust it so they invest in properties or things like that.

3184	12940	just		Hello, Sir, may I help you?__eou__Yes. I would like some information for requesting a loan.__eou__Very well, here are the general terms of our loan policies. We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.__eou__I see. So let me get this straight. If I borrow let’s say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?__eou__It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate. This of course is considering that you don’t default on a payment!	It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.	It sounds good but, there is one problem. I have a terrible credit score.	That is a very serious problem you see, the bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan.

I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home.	Let me just check that on my computer. Oakfield is a low risk area, so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month. The other thing to take into account is deductibles.	Let me check that on my computer. Oakfield is a low risk area, so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month.

73	1010	only		In 1986, a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment. This sport is very challenging. It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance. Especially when descending, as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back, they sway around. The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it. Even if they jump off, they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes. No wonder people give the title' brave' to anyone who jumps off.__eou__You see, the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then, like diving, their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth.

92	1273	only		Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months, what are your general impression of it?__eou__I think, maybe, it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment; meanwhile, I am no more than a beginner. But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life.__eou__You mean, kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined? To some extent your idea holds water. Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense, but with time it became something more than defense skills. Now we are apt to treat it as an art.__eou__An art! You have a good point there. So it is called martial arts in English. The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely. They even made fighting a great enjoyment, so marvelous and fascinating.__eou__Thanks for your compliment! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics. Do you know Jin Yong?__eou__I know he is a martial arts fiction writer. But I've read none of his novels.__eou__All of his works have been translated into English. I recommend you to read one or two works of his. You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture. When you go through the pages, you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone, but cover all walks of life.__eou__I see. They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements.	Yes, take philosophy, for instance. What makes a true, respectable da via, or a warrior hero? It's not enough only to be formidable. It also involves a man's character, sense of justice, and values of life.	Yes, take philosophy, for instance. What makes a true, respectable da via, or a warrior hero?

You know, some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more.__eou__Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older?__eou__I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned.

142	1911	only		A Westerner said to his Chinese friend. “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup. It’s disgusting. ” The Chinese friend replied, “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating. It’s even worse. ”__eou__Everyone has his own habits, but these habits are not very good. The noise often spoils other people’s appetite.__eou__I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States. Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread. Before each course, the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way. We always said “ American way. ” It’s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners. What is the Chinese way?__eou__The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated. The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate. I assume it is less complicated, right?	Not really. I did some research about Chinese table manners. The important rule is to remain silent while eating. Of course, this refers to family meals only. Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health. It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party. The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated. Each dish should be placed in the correct position. When fish is served, the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty. If it is in winter, the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter. Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table. The diners should sit close to the table so food won’t drop on their cloths. No noise should be made when chewing. No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn’t like it. One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise. All these table manners are very similar to Western habits.	Not really. I did some research about Chinese table manners. The important rule is to remain silent while eating.

Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles. We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people’s appetite.Westerners like to say, “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners. ” Is there such an expression in Chinese?

Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.	Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?	Cool! Is that why we work eight hours now?	Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.

We should never give in to terrorist's demands, otherwise where would we be?__eou__Well, that's probably true, but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it.

He was only held for three days, and then they simply released him. It was a case of mistaken identity, and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them.

My father was an child, and didn't really care about having a large family, but my mother talked him into it.	Jeez, seven children. That must have a lot of problems. We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right.
620	7083	only		Darling, I have news for you. Bobby and his wife, Evelyn, are going to have a baby soon.__eou__Really? I thought his wife couldn’t have a baby.__eou__Actually they’re expecting the baby to come on my birthday.__eou__Oh, what a coincidence! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it. He likes children and always wants a child of his own.__eou__In fact, they’re both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese.__eou__Oh, right. Now I know why they would want to see our boy. It’s hard to imagine the wonder! Are they expecting a boy or a girl?	It’s still a mystery. Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now.	It’s still a mystery. Because Evelyn is three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now.	Oh! You mean she doesn’t have to work now?

621	7084	only		Do you have much experience with kids?__eou__Yes. I have three sons. Actually I also have a grandson.__eou__To tell you the truth, sometimes I regret having a baby so early. I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby.__eou__I understand. I was in your position before. At that time I couldn’t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.__eou__What about your mother? Did she help you?	Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That’s it. I had to care for them most of the time.	Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit once or twice a week. That’s it. I had to care for them most of the time.	I see. So if my little family goes to America, I would end up taking care of my child all the time. My husband would have to make the bread for us. I just don’t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day.
622	7089	only		I don’t understand why you always look so happy, so energetic. It seems like you’Ve got good news everyday.__eou__Really? Do I look happy all the time?__eou__All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers.__eou__Oh, do you know why? Actually, it’s easy. Because I always exercise. My exercise, I think, is very hard. I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties. I feel alive!__eou__Oh, I know. I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you.__eou__Yeah, they are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It’s difficult and boring.__eou__It’s true. Many students do the exercise when they have to. We have P. E. once a week.__eou__But I think Chinese students need to exercise more. Besides exercise will help them learn new things better. Don’t students want to have a good memory?	Of course. I didn’t know that. I only know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions?	Of course. I didn’t know that. I know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions?	Well, do what you like to do. It can be anything. Jogging, doing aerobics, going bicycling, and playing ping-pong. Absolutely anything. Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you.

Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain.__eou__But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career?__eou__Yeah, I'd have to say it has. But I'm still paying for it, you know.__eou__I know education is expensive, but it's been my lifelong dream. Call me crazy, but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name.__eou__Well, getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school. Can you afford that? Can you survive that?__eou__I certainly can't afford it, but I'm sure I could find some good student loans.__eou__I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's not as romantic as you might think.__eou__Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate. I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare.	Uh huh, that's for sure. You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students.	Uh huh, that's for sure. You might find that your career choice is teaching other graduate students.

Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.	Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?	Cool! Is that why we work eight hours now?	Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.

That’s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.__eou__Turtles? Whatever ...

At that time I couldn’t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.__eou__What about your mother? Did she help you?	Yes, she did a little.

If we have thirteen people at the table, then it means bad luck. Can Andy bring a date?__eou__I'm not sure. He just broke up with his girlfriend recently, and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon.__eou__But we can't have thirteen for dinner!

1025	11019	only		China is now a member of world trade organization. As a member of TO, China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members. Is it fair to China, do you think?__eou__It's a hard question, but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question. After the establishment of new China, our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy. These policies, however, favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises. After China's entry into TO, Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts. This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies. These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run.__eou__We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement. This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise. Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships?	Yes, it does. Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises, regardless of their nationality and ownership. I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous, these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle. Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies.

First, it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects, because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable. Secondly, it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way, because the person doing the survey usually doesn’t have the patience to wait for long feedback.

He's the hot shot, the main guy who is the boss. If there is one person with absolute power in the organization, everyone knows that the power will go to their head. It's too dangerous. That's the reason for a Board of Directors. The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry. They could be related to the organization, but more commonly, they are independent and non-biased.	How many people are on the board of directors?

As I said in my email, we can help you with production according to your needs, but we will be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis.	Oh, yes. I reviewed your estimate.

1089	12047	only		Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set?__eou__We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers? That will be a large order, probably about two or three cases. The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock.__eou__You can double check with the housekeeping department, but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges. Last time when we made our order to the supplier, the quantity was also especially high. They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us. As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance, they can usually fill the order.__eou__OK, I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure. Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it?	I think the only thing is toner. Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow. We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis. Anyhow, see what you can do to expedite the order this time.

1092	12080	only		I’m glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr. Johnson. I can’t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely!__eou__No problem, if possible I always combine business with pleasure. Now, let’s hear more about these chocolates you’re offering.__eou__Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They’re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.__eou__Mmmm, sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates, where are they produced? Belgium?__eou__Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.__eou__Really? I didn’t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ...__eou__That’s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They’Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!__eou__Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth ...	Unique, aren’t they? I bet you’Ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one’s cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the creme make it through inspection.

As you know, you’Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week, and this will negativity impact the team’s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.__eou__I know, I’m really sorry that I missed the deadline. But really, it wasn’t my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute, and that I couldn’t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis. You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable, then I wouldn’t have missed my deadline.__eou__Oh, come on! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You’re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues, rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.	No, I’m not trying to pass the buck here; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done. But the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn’t gone down. And you know, with everything I’Ve got going on now, I can’t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems. I’Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ...

I’m not going to accept this excuse. You’re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you’Ve missed your deadline. Look, we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards. No more phoney cases. If you’re in over your head, you tell me. No more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by nine am!

I thought you were pleased with his overall performance. Didn’t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?__eou__Yeah, his attitude is great, but he’s really unreliable.Sometimes he’s really productive, but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance, he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting!__eou__Well, I’m sure he had a perfectly good reason ...	But that’s not the only thing ... you know, he really doesn’t have the best work ethic, I’m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.	But that’s not the thing ... you know, he really doesn’t have the best work ethic, I’m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous?__eou__Yeah, I guess so. I've never actually heard of this one, but ...__eou__Well, it's small, but it's a young, dynamic, rapidly-growing company with a progressive, humanistic philosophy.__eou__You didn't read their brochure or anything, did you?__eou__Four times. I'm totally prepared. Oh, no! I forgot to take off my nail polish! And I have to be there in 15 minutes! That's it. I blew it.__eou__Well, they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish. Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great.

Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products.__eou__Yes, of course.__eou__Well, the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So, Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo, but the products are very simple.__eou__And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad.__eou__That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great. It is really great. I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least. Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing.__eou__So what you are really trying to sell is a fad.__eou__Yes, we would like to make things like key chains, plastic pencil sharpeners, plastic rulers, watches, wallets, things like that.Little accessories for young people. But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty.__eou__I understand. But why won't you show me the logo?__eou__Because it hasn't been copyrighted. We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright, we are investigating companies to produce the products.__eou__I see.

We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box.	I think I'll go for the smallest, as it's just for documents. Will I be the only key holder? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time.	I think I'll go for the smallest, as it's just for documents. Will I be the key holder?

1122	12563	only		Welcome to Lincoln Bank. What can we do for you?__eou__Morning. I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it.__eou__Well, there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card.__eou__Yes, of course. It's so much easier than cash, to be honest; nowadays I hardly ever use cash. I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month.__eou__You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month.__eou__Really?__eou__Yes, you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment.__eou__So, if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum?__eou__Yes. As long as you keep making regular monthly payments, paying the minimum is just fine. Of course, your credit limit will be lowered accordingly.__eou__How so?__eou__For example, if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB, your available credit will be 4,000 RIB. So, your credit limit drops.	Oh, I see. Well, I don't plan on only paying the minimum, but it's good to know that I can if I had to. Thanks for that.	Oh, I see.

It won't give it back!__eou__I see ... calm down, don't worry. May I ask what were you doing when it took your card?	Yes. I was only entering my PIN. I'm terrible at remembering it, I'm so forgetful, you see.	Yes. I was entering my PIN. I'm terrible at remembering it, I'm so forgetful, you see.	Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it, please?
1124	12633	only		You heard who won the election, right?__eou__Who was elected?__eou__McCain won the election.__eou__That can’t be true!__eou__I’m upset, too.__eou__I can’t believe people voted for him.__eou__People must want him as our President.__eou__That doesn’t make any sense.__eou__I have more bad news.__eou__How could the news get any worse?

Do I really have to give 90 days notice if I want my money?	Actually, you only need to give 7 days notice if you wish to withdraw funds. Of course, you will lose some interest due to the withdrawal.

I need to get some Traveller's Cheques.__eou__We do always recommend people take Traveller's Cheques when travelling overseas. The world is a dangerous place nowadays, you never know.	Sure. At least if I do get robbed, heaven forbid, I can get my money back using the traveller's cheques insurance.

1134	12866	only		Mr. Brown, I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem. I'd like, if possible, to see it settled at this meeting.__eou__What is it, Mrs. Wang?__eou__It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms. They reached us two weeks ago, and were immediately examined after they arrived. To our astonishment, about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms. We can't accept them in this state. They are unfit for human consumption. And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them.__eou__Is that so? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind. Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years. We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten. Have you any evidence?__eou__Certainly. Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London, whose testimony is absolutely reliable.__eou__Though everything may be as you say, there are many factors involved. What's more, your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage.__eou__The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags, sixty of these bags to a carton. It is stated on the surveyor? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact. So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing.__eou__As you know, before shipment, the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question. They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export.	I think the Inspection Bureau at your end, when effecting inspection, only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard. The part that was not dried properly, most probably, escaped their attention. As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment, I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss.

The part that was not dried properly, most probably, escaped their attention. As the amount in question is 20 % of the whole shipment, I think it is reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss.	The inspection certificate, which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand, is considered final and binding upon both parties. We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit, because you bought the goods F. O. B. Houston and on shipping quality, not on landed quality. Your claim, in our opinion, should be referred to the insurance company, as the mishap occurred after shipment.
1135	12870	only		I’m interested in all kinds of your products, but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense. Please quote us C. I. F. Rangoon.__eou__Please let us know the quantity required so that we can work out the premium and freight charges.__eou__I’m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense.__eou__All right. Here are our F. O. B. price lists. All the prices are subject to our final confirmation.__eou__Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount. You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers.	We usually offer on a net basis only. Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price.	We usually offer on a net basis. Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price.

We have made a lot of improvement in packing. You are welcome to see the sample in the showroom. I think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done.
1137	12878	only		Mr. Black, when is the earliest shipment you can make?__eou__In April or early May.__eou__I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us. Our customs formalities are quite complicated, and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country. The fertilizers must be delivered before April, or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing.	In that case, we will have to improve one month further on the time. Now is Jan. If the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of March, only 2 months are left. The time is too limited.	In that case, we will have to improve one month further on the time. Now is Jan.

Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value, up to the port of destination.	I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount.
1139	12889	only		Well, we've settled the problems of price, quality and quantity. What mode of payment do you wish to employ?__eou__Irrevocable letter of credit, of course. It's the normal terms of payment in international business.__eou__Could you adopt D / A or D / P? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit. That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports, especially for such a huge order.__eou__You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum.__eou__Anyhow, there would be certain bank charges. We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit. It would help me greatly, if you could accept D / A or D / P. It makes no difference to you, but it does to me.	Well. As you understand, the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker’s guarantee. We always ask for L / C for our exports, and the other way around, we pay by L / C for our imports. We only accept L / C for regular orders.	Well.

1140	12890	only		What kind of document is an invoice?__eou__It's a document from the seller to the buyer. It contains full particulars of the goods sold, such as quantity, quality, price, forwarding particulars, and terms of payment.__eou__How many kinds of foreign invoices are there?__eou__Four. They are Loco invoice, FOB invoice, CIF invoice and Franco invoice.__eou__What does the price in different kinds of invoices include?	By Loco invoice, the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller. By FOB invoice, the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered. By CIF invoice, the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance. The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination.

1141	12898	only		I'd like to apply for a credit card. Can you help me with my application?__eou__I'd be glad to.__eou__I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history. I just came to this country.__eou__Do you have an account with this bank?__eou__I'm afraid not.__eou__In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also. That would help with your credit card application.__eou__What is the interest rate on your card?__eou__The annual charge rate is 9.5 %.__eou__That's very expensive!	Not really. The credit card is a revolving account. You only pay interest on what you owe.	Not really. The credit card is a revolving account. You pay interest on what you owe.

1142	12904	only		I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks.__eou__Yes, Mr. Bergeron. You mentioned that in your letter. To tell you the truth, your proposal surprised us.__eou__Is that so? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person, so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration. Our firm specializes in this line of business. We have six sales representatives, who are on the road all the time, covering the whole of the European market.__eou__Do you sell direct to shops?__eou__Yes, we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts. We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct, without any middlemen.__eou__Do you keep a stock of these things?__eou__In some cases, such as the wristwatches, which always have a steady market, we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents. Generally, however, we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply. We are paid for our service, of course.__eou__That is, your commission.__eou__Yes, our commission is very reasonable. We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal.__eou__Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission.__eou__The European market is not familiar with your products. You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries. At the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs. A 10 % commission will not leave us much.__eou__According to your estimate, what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill, in round figures, of course?__eou__We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business, as our remuneration increases with the turnover, but we will not guar - ante anything, at least not to begin with.__eou__We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products. But our suggestion to you, Mr. Bergeron, as a preliminary step, is to do a little research into the market ...__eou__Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency?__eou__Mr. Bergeron, you leave us no alternative. We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover. Besides our price is worked out according to the costing. A 10 % commission means an increase in our price. We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect.__eou__Oh, that's just too bad. I intended to make great efforts in selling your products.	Well, we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement. To start the ball rolling, we will provide you with price lists, catalogues and some samples. Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products, can we then discuss further details.

1143	12908	only		I have here our price sheet on a F. O. B. basis. The prices are given without engagement.__eou__Good, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll go over the sheet right now.__eou__Take your time.__eou__I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high.__eou__I’m surprised to hear you say so. You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years.	We only ask that your prices be comparable to others. That’s reasonable, isn’t it?	We ask that your prices be comparable to others. That’s reasonable, isn’t it?	Well, to get the business done, we can consider making some concessions in our price. But first, you’ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us, so that we may adjust our prices accordingly.
1144	12912	only		How much will our order from your factory be?__eou__I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days.__eou__I'm afraid I can't wait that long. Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure?__eou__Well, I would need an idea of how large your order would be. About how many units would you need?__eou__Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units.__eou__Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100. Is that price acceptable to you?__eou__Your estimated is seems a little high to me, we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit.	Would an order of only 100 units, it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget. Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units, we might be able to work something out.

1145	12919	only		I’m glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr. Johnson. I can’t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely!__eou__No problem, if possible I always combine business with pleasure. Now, let’s hear more about these chocolates you’re offering.__eou__Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They’re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.__eou__Mmmm, sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates, where are they produced? Belgium?__eou__Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.__eou__Really? I didn’t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production__eou__That’s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They’Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!__eou__Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth ...	Unique, aren’t they? I bet you’Ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one’s cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the creme make it through inspection.

1146	12920	only		We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth. The client thinks it's too dark, and they want to add halogen lighting. We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys, do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens?__eou__Oh ... Um ... I don't think so. you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system. Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you. That's not going to come cheap.	But it would only be adding to the existing structure. We're not talking about anything new here ...	But it would be adding to the existing structure. We're not talking about anything new here ...	It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out, and they are union labor. It'll cost you a pretty penny ...
1147	12922	only		I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both. I've thought through a lot of these details, and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon.__eou__Let's get start. What kinds of things do you have in mind? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning, we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement.__eou__Firstly, we'd like to discuss a discounted price. If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders, we can pay in 60 days.__eou__Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do. How about this? We'll give you a discount of 4 %, but you can have 90 days credits.__eou__Well, that might be acceptable, if you handle the insurance fees.__eou__No, you have to take care of the insurance. But we are willing to pay the half transport. Can you accept that?	We cover the insurance and half the transport fee, and only have a discount of 4 %.	We cover the insurance and half the transport fee, and have a discount of 4 %.	But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit.

We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents.	We accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents.	I see. Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P?
1149	12935	only		I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem.__eou__I should say it is something we have never come across before.__eou__The Federal Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA as we call it for short, imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States. Over the years, they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers.__eou__In my opinion, overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports.__eou__Ah, there's something in what you're saying. According to the present FDA regulations, the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States.__eou__Why not? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad, and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers. Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are?__eou__I'd be quite willing to if I could, but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law, or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs.__eou__In that case, what can we do to help you? Have you any suggestions?__eou__Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C. I. F. basis for delivery in Hong Kong? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations.	Do you think that's the only way out? You know we usually do the labeling, as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products.	Do you think that's the way out?

1150	12936	only		Mr. Jones, shall we now discuss the packaging?__eou__Very well. You know, we have definite ways of packaging garments. As to blouses, we use a polythene wrapper for each article, all ready for window display.	Good. A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales. With competition from similar garments producers, the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive.	Good. A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales.

We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse.
1151	12939	only		It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods.__eou__And that is?__eou__How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York?__eou__I'm afraid we can't agree to that. We concluded the business with you here in Houston, and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York. We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle. Hong Kong is out of the question.	It's like this. There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka, while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent. If shipment were effected from Hong Kong, we could receive the goods much earlier.	It's like this.

4	1513	simply		The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest.__eou__Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much? The same is true in the West.__eou__No, absolutely not! On the contrary, you'll be considered a well-connected, sociable man, if you keep involved in the conversation all the time. But always pay attention to what you say. If the table has a senior guest, say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible.

That goes in like with Confucius' preachings, right?__eou__Correct. Show respect for the older people.

People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others. And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely.__eou__Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient?

5	1515	simply		In China at least, coffee is often associated with an exotic, well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle. Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated, middle-class people.__eou__Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar, surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop. While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace, they are actually showing off!__eou__Yes. Behind a lifestyle, there is a culture. Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life. While they may not really like coffee, they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places.__eou__Then what about tea? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea, rather than coffee, has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people.	Well. Tea represents another facet of popular culture. While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft, elegant music, a teahouse is often a noisy, crowded, public space. People visit teahouses to associate with others, playing chess, chatting, or simply listening to operas.	Well. Tea represents another facet of popular culture.
