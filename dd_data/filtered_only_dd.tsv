73	1010	only		In 1986, a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment. This sport is very challenging. It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance. Especially when descending, as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back, they sway around. The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it. Even if they jump off, they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes. No wonder people give the title' brave' to anyone who jumps off.__eou__You see, the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then, like diving, their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth. The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend. They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord.__eou__Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage.	"A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said, "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform, I was extremely nervous. When I looked down, I was nervous even more. If the cord had broken, I would be knocked to' bakemeat'. However, I knew my worries were unwanted. I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me. I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward. I only felt wind wiring at my ears. My body rapidly descended. I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord. In fact it was 30 seconds. Maybe because of my nervousness, I only felt seven or eight seconds. When rebounding to the high altitude, I felt a sudden sense of relief. I did not feel nervous very much, but very comfortable.

I mean, it is so hard to be a working mother.	I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself, like keeping housework simple, spending money on things that make life easier, buying yourself things you like, and so on.

It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly. As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly, they often knew chasing hard after the ball, but forgot to steal it.	Haha. That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common, and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent. And the ball is often kept flying overhead, drawing beautiful curves in the sky. Such games are quite pleasing to the eye.

1073	11787	only		How do you think a manager should react to an employee’s unsatisfactory work?__eou__If I were a manager, I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons.

Exactly, I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning, they were from the company on the 12th floor, I guess. They were only three of us in the elevator, I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them.

1087	12008	only		So tell me, what's the difference between the Board of Directors, the CEO, and the stockholders? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...	No, there's a definite difference. You know, the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system. Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer. He's the hot shot, the main guy who is the boss. If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization, everyone knows that the power will go to their head. It's too dangerous. That's the reason for a Board of Directors. The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry. They could be related to the organization, but more commonly, they are independent and non-biased.	No, there's a definite difference.

1093	12083	only		And so, I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project. As you know, you’Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week, and this will negativity impact the team’s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.__eou__I know, I’m really sorry that I missed the deadline. But really, it wasn’t my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute, and that I couldn’t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis. You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable, then I wouldn’t have missed my deadline.__eou__Oh, come on! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You’re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues, rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.	No, I’m not trying to pass the buck here; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done. But the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn’t gone down. And you know, with everything I’Ve got going on now, I can’t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems. I’Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ...

I’m not going to accept this excuse. You’re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you’Ve missed your deadline. Look, we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards. No more phoney cases. If you’re in over your head, you tell me. No more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by nine am!
